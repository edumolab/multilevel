    <h3>House/Flat (Apartment)</h3>
    <p><strong>Do you live in a house or a flat?</strong></p>
    <p>I live in a rented Oat in Hangzhou. I&rsquo;ve been living in the flat for over three years since I found a job here.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you prefer to live in a house or a flat?</strong></p>
    <p><br />I'd like to live in a house as the one my family have in the countryside. There is much space in the three-storey house where my parents, my brother and my grandma live. We have a garden backyard where we plant many flowers which are my favourite. However, it's impossible to enjoy that while living in a flat.</p>
    <p><strong>Why do you like your home?</strong></p>
    <p>I like my home for there are my family. There is no comfortable place as a home. My family at home give me comfort, making me feel safe.</p>
    <p><strong>Which room you like best at your home?</strong></p>
    <p>I like my study best. I spent a lot of time in the study where there is a full shelf of books. I like reading, especially novels. Each year I received books as gifts from my relatives. I used to invite my friends to study with me in the room, and we often lost ourselves in reading books there.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you have a plan to move to a new house/ flat in the future?</strong></p>
    <p>I've been living alone in the flat, and I seldom have time to go back home. In the future I hope to buy a flat in the city, in the following two or three years if possible. Though I prefer to have my own house, I cannot afford the high house price.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you think can be added to your flat?</strong></p>
    <p>Maybe a dancing room that has lots of mirrors, because in that way, my mother and I can practice dancing in our spare time at home, and we don't need to go to the fitness club.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you know your neighbors? Is it good to know your neighbors?</strong></p>
    <p><br />Yes, I do. We have a really good relationship with my neighbors, because we will send each other foods or other things. Also, we will help each other if we encounter some problems.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you prefer young or old neighbors?</strong></p>
    <p><br />I don't mind. I believe that everyone in the world in very kind, so no matter my neighbor is young or old, if we treat each other friendly, we must get along well with each other.</p>
