<h3>Art</h3>
<h4>How do people in your country feel about art?</h4>
<p>Answer: We, humans, are &ldquo;unique&rdquo; in our existence and experience. Therefore, it is only natural that we have our needs and expectation that are unique as well. But among those unique needs and expectation, that separates us from animals, enjoying art seems to be something that makes us &ldquo;truly&rdquo; unique as humans. So, what is the general purpose of art? Well, the answer is, art helps us to look at ourselves little &ldquo;closer&rdquo; in a different light by explaining our desire and expectation in more details which otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. With the help of art, we are able to communicate our social, political, cultural and spiritual ideas in a much more organized manner so that we feel &ldquo;challenged&rdquo; to rethink over the issues and the subjects that are affecting us and our surroundings on a daily basis. We enjoy art because it stimulates our hearts and minds to appreciate our lives in a more positive light. We enjoy art also because it makes us feel &ldquo;different&rdquo; by combining our &ldquo;unusual motifs&rdquo; that weave their way into our &ldquo;subconscious&rdquo; (or the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; us) and alter our mood so that we feel free to travel into a different<br />realm.</p>
<h4>How has art changed in the past few decades in your country?</h4>
<p>Answer: I am no art expert, but as far as I can understand, art has certainly changed in the last few decades in my country. For example, before a few decades, any artwork, be it a drama performance, film, or painting work, used to be &ldquo;original&rdquo; and &ldquo;thought-provoking&rdquo;. But these days, most artworks are void of any particular &ldquo;message&rdquo; or sometimes bear complex meanings which could possibly reflect our society and lifestyle in general. Besides, before a few decades ago, artists were reluctant to stay close to &ldquo;power and establishment&rdquo;, but these days, their artworks act as some kind of &ldquo;mouthpiece&rdquo; of the &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; most of the times. Finally, in the past, artworks mostly reflected our own culture and tradition but they are more "universal" in these days.</p>
<h4>Do you think children should study art in school?</h4>
<p>Answer: Art is like food for the soul, and that&rsquo;s why children can benefit a lot from learning at school. To start with, through learning art children can draw their &ldquo;creativities&rdquo; out in the light by painting some interesting art pieces or by acting in a certain way in drama class. Learning art may also increase patience and determination in children because it takes a long time and efforts to learn and understand this subject. Finally, it also promotes teamwork and problem-solving skills as the children learn to collaborate and compete with each other in order to do well in art classes.</p>
