<p><strong>1. Why do you think people go to restaurants when they want to celebrate something?</strong><br />Answer:&nbsp;In my opinion, restaurants probably are one of the most popular public places, where all kinds of people can visit with the most ease. And it is probably this high level of &ldquo;ease&rdquo;, and the absence of an &ldquo;uncomfortable feeling&rdquo; for many of being stuck in a private place, that makes restaurants a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or event. Besides, it is just not always possible to accommodate and serve so many guests together in a private place, like a home or office, because of the lack of logistic support and other things, which is usually not the case with restaurants. Finally, people often want to indulge themselves with the menus that are served at a restaurant to satisfy their taste buds and decide to celebrate an event at a restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Which are more popular in your country: fast food restaurants or traditional restaurants? Why do you think that is?</strong><br />Answer:&nbsp;There is no doubt that fastfood restaurants are gaining huge popularity steadily, but traditional restaurants are still, by far, the more popular food outlet of the two in our country. There could be a number of reasons that attribute to the popularity of the traditional restaurants, but I will just mention two of those reasons here: the first reason, of course, traditional foods, more often than not, are generally more healthy and tasty. The second reason is that the traditional foods, surprisingly in many cases, are cheaper than that of the fastfood restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>3. Some people say that food in an expensive restaurant is always better than food in a cheap restaurant &ndash; would you agree?</strong><br />Answer:&nbsp;If the word &ldquo;better&rdquo; in the question here means that the foods at an expensive restaurant are always delicious and healthy, then I will just have to disagree with the substance of this question. After all, the quality of foods, be it served at an expensive restaurant or a cheap one, doesn&rsquo;t depend on how much exactly is charged for the foods, but on how fresh or good the raw materials really are, and how they are cooked or prepared on a given day. From my experince, I can say that, several times, I have tasted far better food in a moderate restaurant while I could not enjoy my food in a highly expensive restaurant.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Do you think there will be a greater choice of food available in shops in the future, or will there be less choice?</strong><br />Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do think that markets and shops will serve a greater choice of foods in the future as the taste and preferences of people always keep changing, not only with regard to the foods, but also with many other things. Besides, foods are something which we have to have on a regular basis to survive, and sometimes, it just may not always be possible to grow or have the same kinds of foods or food grains because of the changes in the weather system or market trends. And so, it is only natural that people will try to find different types of foods to meet their demands. Finally, global trade agreements and technological development will make it possible to import foods, fruits, and grains from all around the world, giving consumers a much wider choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. What effects has modern technology had on the way food is produced?</strong><br />Answer:&nbsp;Well, for better or worse, technology has changed the way we live and produce the things that we may need. In fact, it is because of the food engineering technologies today, like genetic modification of foods, that we have managed to produce a rather large quantity of foods within a short period of time. Besides, by using these modern technologies, things like food preservation, processing, packaging and distribution have always become relatively easy and effective as far as the issue of using safe foods is concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. How important is it for a country to be able to grow all the food it needs, without importing any from other countries?</strong><br />Answer:&nbsp;It is very important that a country is able to grow all the foods without importing anything from other countries because it would ensure some kind of food security for its own citizens. Besides, such schemes would also help a country gain even more financially and economically by opening doors to more economic activities and creating better job opportunities for its own citizens. Finally, it will also stop a country from falling victim to more powerful nations &ndash; powerful nations who might use the supply of foods as a &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; - at a time of international conflict. However, practically speaking, it is not feasible for most countries in the world to grow and produce all the fooods they need, which means importing foods and grains will always be an important aspect.</p>
