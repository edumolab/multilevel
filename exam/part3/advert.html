<li>Do you think advertising influences what people buy?</li>
<li>Is advertising really necessary in modern society?</li>
<li>Is there any advertising that can be harmful to children?</li>
</ol>
<h4>1. Do you think advertising influences what people buy?</h4>
<p>Yes, definitely. If there were no advertising and you went to a shop, then you would just buy what you wanted based on maybe what others have told you, what the product looks like, or, depending on the product, what it says on the label. Advertising builds up a brand and people then trust a certain thing because they have seen it on television or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Also, there is so much advertising around it must influence us. You can&rsquo;t escape it as it is fed to us constantly in our daily lives &ndash; not only in magazines, radio and television, but on billboards, on TVs installed on trains and platforms, even in schools and universities. So yes, advertising influences what we buy.</p>
<h4>2. Is advertising really necessary in modern society?</h4>
<p>It could be seen to be necessary in terms of the fact that, as I mentioned before, there is so much choice that we need someone to guide us in what to buy or to give us some extra information about products. Without this, it would be difficult to know where to start. However, that said, I&rsquo;m not sure that I would regard it as &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; as overall I think it may do more harm than good. As we just discussed, advertising encourages people to buy things they possibly do not need. We live in a consumer society and many people are in debt because we are encouraged to buy and buy, and I&rsquo;m sure advertising plays a major role in this. Without advertising we could just do our own research and decide what we really need. So no, I would not say that advertising in necessary in modern society</p>
<h4>3. How does advertising influence children?</h4>
<p><em>Good answer starters: </em></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;children are an extremely vulnerable target audience How ads influence children:</li>
<li>commercials make children pester their parents for junk food, expensive toys and modern gadgets</li>
<li>children make excessive demands on their parents for the products they see in the ads, especially if they were advertised by their favourite characters&nbsp;</li>
<li>some children even have tantrums in public if their parents refuse to buy products the see in ads</li>
<li>children often imitate specific behaviours they see in ads</li>
<li>advertising affects kids&rsquo; well-being</li>
<li>advertising leads children to choose junk food instead of healthy options</li>
<li>advertising causes changes in children&rsquo;s behaviour. Why this happens:</li>
<li>children take everything at face value and therefore they are easy to persuade</li>
<li>children are cognitively and psychologically defenceless against advertising</li>
<li>children are not able to understand persuasive character of advertising messages.</li>
</ul>
