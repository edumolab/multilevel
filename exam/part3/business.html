<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. What do you think is the retirement age for men and women?</strong></h4>
<p>It is my opinion that there should be no&nbsp;restriction&nbsp;regarding the age to which men and women can work. As long as their health allows and their company requires their services, they can keep on contributing, and retire only when they feel that they have&nbsp;reached their limit. Old employees&rsquo; experience and&nbsp;wisdom&nbsp;can be extremely valuable, and I think it is a huge loss&nbsp;when they are forced to retire while they are still&nbsp;physically and mentally capable.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. What kinds of qualities do people need to run their own business?</strong></h4>
<p>There are a few factors that&nbsp;come into play, but&nbsp;at the top of the list, I think a business owner must be extremely well-organized. Running a business is&nbsp;no simple feat, and if an&nbsp;entrepreneur&nbsp;can&rsquo;t plan things well and manage the many different aspects of a company, the situation will be very&nbsp;chaotic. In addition, those who want to be their own boss should have a clear vision, because no business can&nbsp;thrive&nbsp;without its identity figured out and a&nbsp;well-thought-out&nbsp;development plan.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. What do you think are the key factors that contribute to the success of a business?</strong></h4>
<p>I personally think that, more than anything, a company must have a&nbsp;competitive advantage&nbsp;in order to become successful. In other words, they should&nbsp;gain an edge over&nbsp;their competitors in a particular aspect, be it price, user experience or&nbsp;uniqueness.</p>
<p>Besides, a strong team can be a major contributor to the success of a business. A good smartphone, for example, may not sell if there isn&rsquo;t a strong marketing team to&nbsp;bring it to the public eye&nbsp;and a capable sales team to convince its customers to&nbsp;make a purchase.</p>
