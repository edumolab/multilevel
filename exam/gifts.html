    <h3>Gifts</h3>
    <p><strong>What is your favourite gift?</strong></p>
    <p>I received lots of gifts from my relatives and friends, among which I liked the bicycle best. It's a birthday present from my parents when I was ten, and it's rare to have a mountain bike at that time. I used to ride it to study and it makes my life more convenient.</p>
    <p><strong>Have you ever received a gift that you didn't like?</strong></p>
    <p>Well, I haven't received any gift I dislike, but I do have gifts I pile up for years, such as soft toys. I don't like soft toys so much as other girls, and I have about twenty toys in various types in stock.</p>
    <p><strong>When was the last time you received a gift?</strong></p>
    <p>Actually it is today. My best friend came home from Taiwan, and she bought me some delicious snacks from Taiwan, so today was the last time I received a gift, and I love the taste very much.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you prefer receiving a gift or giving a gift?</strong></p>
    <p>I prefer receiving a gift. For giving a gift, I need to consider the interest of that person, and sometimes it may not be accurate, so it is very hard to send gifts. But for receiving a gift, you can decide if you like it or not.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you think it&rsquo;s difficult to choose what gift to give to people?</strong></p>
    <p>Of course it is very different to choose gifts for people. Everyone is different. I need to consider the interest of that person, and sometimes it may not be accurate, so it is very hard to send gifts.</p>
    <p><strong>What were the gifts you sent to others recently?</strong></p>
    <p>I sent to my friends some cosmetics such as the eye shadow makeup or the daycare cream. Besides, I also sent one of my friends a blue bag that is very cute, and she liked it very much.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you like giving gifts to your friends?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, of course. I always bring some gifts to my friends if I travel. If they like my gifts very much, I will also feel very happy. So I like to choose gifts for them. Also, gifts can express my love to my friends or family members.</p>
