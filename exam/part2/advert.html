<h3>Describe an advertisement that persuaded you to buy a product</h3>
<ol>
<li>What advertisement it was</li>
<li>Was it shown on TV, radio or newspaper</li>
<li>What was good about that advertisement</li>
<li>Explain why do you think that advertisement attracted you to buy the product&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><br /><strong>Sample Answer&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><br />Undoubtedly, the advent of social media has given <strong>a duly kick to</strong> advertisers and promoters worldwide. These days, we can find ourselves surrounded by <strong>persuasive promotions</strong> on almost every channel, whether offline or online. In my opinion, I find TV advertisements to be more informative and <strong>gripping</strong> than the ones<br />appearing on social media. Last week, I came across an ad on TV by Samsung wherein the brand was promoting their latest release &ndash; the Samsung Galaxy S21.<br />In the advertisement, a young lady seemingly was on a road trip with her friends where she used the Samsung Galaxy S21 to record her surroundings and click pictures of her friends. I found the concept <strong>enthralling</strong>; hence, I decided not to change the channel and watch it till the end.<br />Also, alongside the lady trying to capture everything, the brand had listed out the specifications and essential features of the phone. The beauty and elegant design of the phone were highlighted, which impressed me greatly. This advertisement <strong>pinpointed</strong> everything required to know to buy this phone, from the display size to the <strong>battery capacity.</strong><br />Since I was planning to upgrade my phone to a newer version, I was influenced by this commercial. Post the advertisement, I instantly searched for more features and pricing of the phone on the internet. I liked almost everything about it; thus, I ordered one myself.<br />All in all, I can state that the TV advertisements are influential, at least for me, as I ended up making this significant purchase merely because of a commercial.</p>
