<h3>Describe your favourite movie/film.</h3>
<p><strong>You should say:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>what it is</li>
<li>when you watched it</li>
<li>what it is about</li>
<li>and explain why this is your favourite movie.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I usually pass my leisure hours by participating in sports but recently I have started watching movies at home. Last month, I watched a movie named Life is Beautiful and now this has become my favourite one. This is one of the special movies that I have ever seen.</p>
<p>The movie belongs to comedy-drama genre. It comes with different issues during the holocaust. Besides, the movie plot is outstanding and the performance of the characters are splendid. The movie was made in 1997 and was directed by Roberto Benigni. He also was the lead actor in the movie. Moreover, he also co-wrote the movie. The plot of this movie reminds people of the Second World War when the Nazi concentration camps were used to punish the opposition and the ordinary people. The movie also demonstrates the love of a father to his son and how he protects the son from dangers inside the concentration camp.</p>
<p>Usually, I take part in sport in the evening hours. But during the holidays, I spent my times at the home. And when I am at home, I watch movies or listen to music. This time, instead of listening music, I watched the movie. I was accompanied by my family members. In fact, my mother loves to watch movies and I developed the habit from her. She loves to watch drama movies and in line with her interest, I also grew a taste for drama movies. Actually, when I am inside the movie, it is hard indeed to detach me from the watching. The similar thing happened with this one. This is the movie, that comes with some comical and dramatic elements. So, I enjoyed the movie until the last moment. I started watching the movie at around 4.00 pm and finished it after nearly two hours. I was glued to the screen by this time and gained a different experience.</p>
<p>The movie is about a couple of things. It appeared to me that the movie has been made to make the viewers aware of the detrimental impacts of the holocaust -how the event destroyed families and people. On the other side, the movie is about the affection of a father to his son. The eternal love of the father to his son is demonstrated here. An ordinary Jewish father sacrifices his life to save his son from the Nazi occupation during the World War II. The father is taken to the concentration camp with his son. After reaching the camp, he meets with many other people. He also meets with his wife. Unluckily the meeting was short. But he uses his extraordinary imaginations to save the son from the Nazi forces. And finally, he becomes successful in protecting the son in exchange for his life.</p>
<p>This is my favourite movie for many reasons. This is one of the movies that has won several prestigious awards. The movie plot is outstanding while the movie making was excellent. The movie plot is the key attraction here. An open-minded Jewish man is held without any charge and sent to the concentration camp. Finally, he lost his life &ndash; a soldier shot him before leaving the camp during the invasion by the allied forces. But he saved his son. He developed a story and played the role of a character in the story to let his son know that the events were a game. The events turned tragic finally. Life was beautiful to his son and wife. He could not taste the liberty. Considering the inner issues, I love this movie.</p>
