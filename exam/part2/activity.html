<h3>Describe an interesting activity that you enjoy doing on weekends.</h3>
<p>With the job, study and other responsibilities I have a busy schedule in my daily life and over the number of activities I had got limited. Yet, I maintain some of the activities I really enjoy. One such activity is hanging out with friends during my day-offs. We often meet at a place in the evening and enjoy our time. Sometimes we meet at a public place like a park or a field and sometimes we go to watch the theatre. I mostly do it with my close friends and we have 4-5 such friends who meet each other on our day-offs.</p>
<p>I enjoy spending times with my friends as they are my long time friends and have a good understanding. I enjoy the topic we discuss or even the chit-chat we have in our conversation. As&nbsp;all of us got busy over time, we can&rsquo;t meet very often and our meeting on our day-offs helps us maintaining our social gathering and friendship. We often plan to go to worth watching theatrical performance and movies and enjoy our time. This is indeed a good activity, at least to me, as I value their friendship and enjoy their company.</p>
<p>Good friends are like treasures in life as I have often found their help in times of distress and need. Thus the activity I have allows&nbsp;me to spend some quality times, get their updates, discuss on topics that I learn things from and allow me doing some activities that otherwise would not have been possible.</p>
