<h3>Describe a book you have read. You should say:</h3>
<ol>
<li>What kind of book it is?&nbsp;</li>
<li>When you read it?</li>
<li>What is about?</li>
<li>And explain why you think it is exciting?</li>
</ol>
<p>Books play an essential role in every student&rsquo;s/ person&rsquo;s life because books providing knowledge of the outside world, introduce them to a world of imagination, improving their reading, writing and speaking skills, and boosting memory and intelligence. I like to read motivational, story and investigation related books.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to talk about a crime and investigation related book.&nbsp; The book name is<strong> "Crime and Punishment"</strong>. It is a novel written by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly instalments during 1866. It is a murder storybook that is told from a murder&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p><br />People did work and study from home. Due to the pandemic, everyone stayed at home last year. At that time, I had much free time, so to utilize the free time, I started to read a different kinds of books. As I said earlier, I like investigation and crime-related books, so I downloaded some books online, and crime and punishment were one of these books.</p>
<p>Book explain a murder&rsquo;s point of view, behaviour, emotions before and after the murder. The novel&rsquo;s first masterpiece is a psychological analysis of a person, who thinks that he is an extraordinary/ very unusual person able to take on the spiritual(relating to soul or human spirit as opposed to material or physical things) responsibility of using evil means to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am keen to know different types of behaviour, and this book helped me to let know the unique feeling and emotions of murder, so that&rsquo;s why I think it is an exciting book.</p>
