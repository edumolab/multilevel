<h3>Describe a positive change in your life</h3>

<li>What the change was about</li>

<li>details of the change happened</li>
<li>and how it affected you later in life</li>
</ol>
<p>The positive change that I would like to talk about is &lsquo;I started playing outdoor games instead of playing computer games&rsquo;. After I got my first personal computer when I was only 9 years old or so, I started learning many things. Besides that, I started playing computer games. As computer games are addictive I found that I was playing the games whenever I had spare times. This addiction barred me from playing outdoor games like cricket, football etc. I found myself very much attracted to computer games and I preferred to play the games at home instead of going to open spaces or fields to participate in outdoor games that involve physical exercises. Not that computer games are all so bad, but playing them all the time someone<br />has got is not a good thing especially for kids. I found that I was spending more times at home than being outside. After my parents noticed that, they discussed with me about that and explained to me the importance of outdoor activities. They gave me strict restriction that I would only be able to play computer games for an hour daily and in the evening I&rsquo;d have to go outside to play with my friends.</p>
<p>This was obviously a very positive change for me. I&rsquo;m not against computer games but I feel that if there are more important things to do, then we should not spend time on computer games only.</p>
<p>This change affected me very positively. I became a good cricket player, later on, I started maintaining my times more prudently and I am sure this change has affected me positively in terms of physical and mental health.</p>
