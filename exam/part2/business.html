<h3>Describe a successful business that you know about. You should say:&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>what business it is</li>
<li>what this business does</li>
<li>how you know about this business</li>
<li>and explain why you think this business is successful.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who pays much attention to the business world, but there&rsquo;s a company that has inspired me a lot in everything I do. That&rsquo;s Apple &ndash; a giant tech company, the first&nbsp;trillion-dollar business&nbsp;and the most valuable brand in the world. They are&nbsp;renowned&nbsp;for producing the highest-quality technological devices, including smartphones, laptops, desktops, and headphones, among which the iPhone is considered a&nbsp;revolutionary&nbsp;product that changed the world with its release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time I saw an iPhone, it completely blew me away, because it was unlike any other phone on the market at that time. Then I looked up the company behind the product, and was immediately intrigued by its fascinating success story.</p>
<p>Many people probably don&rsquo;t know this, but before becoming this successful, Apple struggled a lot and almost went bankrupt. Its first&nbsp;line of products&nbsp;was not welcomed by the public, and its infamous founder, Steve Jobs, was even fired from his own company. However, with the release of the original Macintosh and the iPhone, Apple managed to pull in lots of attention, and the sales of their products&nbsp;skyrocketed. Its success can be&nbsp;attributed&nbsp;to a few factors.</p>
<p>First of all, it adapts very well to the demand of the market. From a&nbsp;first mover&nbsp;with lots of innovative devices, Apple now waits for a new technology to perfect itself before implementing it in their own products, offering their users not necessarily the first, but certainly the best experience. In this&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;market, no new technology can wow consumers, but an&nbsp;optimal&nbsp;experience can, and Apple is aiming for that.</p>
<p>Besides, Apple is&nbsp;a marketing genius,&nbsp;coming up with brilliant&nbsp;catchphrases&nbsp;and creative&nbsp;campaigns&nbsp;to&nbsp;popularize&nbsp;their products. They also offer the best services in the tech world,&nbsp;overshadowing&nbsp;most of&nbsp;their competitors&nbsp;in this aspect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself an Apple&nbsp;fanatic, but its business principles and practice have inspired me a lot, as I always try to provide my students with the best experience, and never give them any&nbsp;half-baked&nbsp;product or service. The company is definitely having a positive influence on me.</p>
