<h4>1. Where was the last place you visited on holiday?</h4>
<p>I think it was my last year trip to Bukhara. I'd never been there before, so it was a really nice experience for me.</p>
<h4>2. Would you like to go back there again?</h4>
<p>Yes, of course. It was only a day trip and I would like to stay there for a while and explore it fully.</p>
<h4>3. What kind of tourist destinations do you usually prefer?</h4>
<p>I would like to avoid tourist traps at all. The thing is I want to explore the city for the unseen point of view, which unfortunately is not the case with tourist destinations.</p>
