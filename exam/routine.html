	<h3>Daily Routine</h3>
<div class="entry-content clear">
<h4>1. When do you usually get up in the morning?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Well, I am a morning riser, and I usually get up at 6;30 am. Getting up early in the morning makes me feel fresh.</p>
<h4>2. Do you usually have the same routine every day?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Actually, I am a working&nbsp;person, and on weekdays my routine is the same but weekends make me a lazy person. So, I get up late in the morning.</p>
</ins></div>
<h4>3. What is your daily routine?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Well, in the morning, I get up early to have a light breakfast and hit the gym about 7 am. After the one hour workout, I leave the gym and go to the supermarket to buy some fruits and vegetables. Then, I came back home and got ready for work at 10 am.</p>
<h3>4. Do you ever change your routine?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I underwent a change about two months ago because I had a tight schedule and was struggling to manage my targets.</p>
<h4>5. Is your routine the same today as it was when you were a child?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Actually, I can say that there&rsquo;s a vast difference between my life then and my present life. You know, when I was a child, besides focusing on study, I had much free time to pursue my interests like watching television and listening to music. But now, my routine and time management has become strict.</p>
