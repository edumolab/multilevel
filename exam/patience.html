    <h3>Patience</h3>
    <p><strong>Is it important to be patient? Why?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, it is, because people won't do things successfully without being patient. For example, people, more or less, had the experience of making mistakes on a math test because they were not patient enough. Patience, however, enables people to discover where the trap lies and find the key information to a correct answer.</p>
    <p><strong>Is it easy to be patient? Why?</strong></p>
    <p>Well, it depends, some people are patient while others are not. Patience is an expression of one's mood and character. To be patient is not easy, but patience can be developed through habit. It's said going fishing and practicing handwriting helps people to slow down and be patient.</p>
    <p><strong>How can people be patient?</strong></p>
    <p>People lose patience when they meet what seemingly insoluble or when, what they are doing costs longer time than they expected. So I think people should been optimistic, and have an overall judgment of what they engage in. Besides, they can set up goals step by step to reach a final success and they should encourage themselves by whatever improvement they make. In this way, people won't get upset and easily lose their patience.</p>
    <p><strong>When do people need to be patient?</strong></p>
    <p>People need to be patient all the time whatever they are doing. For example, researchers have to spend months or years to collect data for their experiments, and they may repeat a single experiment again and again. Without patience, they may make mistakes or could not hold on to the end.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you do when waiting for the bus or something else?</strong></p>
    <p>While waiting for a bus, I prefer to play games on my cell-phone, or call my friend to kill time. As it is said, the time spent on waiting always seems to be longer than it is. I will lose patience if I do nothing but just wait.</p>
    <p><strong>Are people now less patient than people in the past? Why?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, we do. We are now living in a rapid developing world. Flights and high-speed railways enable people to travel around in short time. Fast food or take-away food makes it convenient for people to eat while walking. Exposed to the world, people are made to get used to and catch up with the fast pace. They have less time left to be patient.</p>
