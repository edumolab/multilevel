<p class="rank-math-question "><strong>1. How do you plan your time in a day?</strong></p>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">
<p>I am strict to myself, so I&rsquo;ve got a daily planner for each single day. Basically speaking, I will finish the most difficult things in the mornings because I feel very active at that moment. As for easier tasks, I would like to put them in the afternoons or evenings.</p>

<p class="rank-math-question "><strong>2. Is easy to manage time for you?</strong></p>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much easy for me to do so, because I&rsquo;m good at making plans and I have been doing time management since I was a little kid. APPs, to-do list, notebook are all useful for me to manage time.</p>

<p class="rank-math-question "><strong>3. When do you find it hard to allocate time?</strong></p>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">
<p>Probably when I am stuck in some disappointments or shocking things. I mean, it&rsquo;s not about how hard the things are, but it&rsquo;s all about how bad I feel. Sometimes I will be emotionally unstable, and that&rsquo;s the moment I feel hard to allocate time, because I can&rsquo;t even think for myself.</p>

<p class="rank-math-question "><strong>7. Do you think planning is important for time management?</strong></p>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">
<p>Planning plays a pivotal role in effective time management. An individual needs to plan his day well in advance to make the best possible use of time. There is no point in working just for the sake of doing work. Planning gives an individual a sense of direction in the organisation and motivates him to complete assignments on time. For instance while I&rsquo;m preparing for my ielts exam I always plan to cover every 4 modules in a day.</p>

<div class="rank-math-answer ">
<p>Well, some people are not that efficient in planning time so that&rsquo;s probably what made them enroll in time management courses, on top of that, it is a systematic course that contains several skills and techniques so making those skills handy will enhance work productivity and overall performance.</p>
