    <h3>Advertisements</h3>
    <p><strong>Are there many advertisements in your country?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, there are. We are surrounded by advertisements, which occupy a lot of space in our life. I am feed up with the advertising messages sent to my cell-phones, which inform me of the sales of houses by estate agency, sales of clothes in a certain mall, and so on.</p>
    <p><strong>Why do you think there are so many advertisements now?</strong></p>
    <p>For one thing, the competition is severe among manufacturers and companies who offer the same type of product or service. By investing in advertisement, they are better known to the public, so as to achieve high sales. For another, the various ways of advertising available makes it possible for them to publicize their product or service.</p>
    <p><strong>What are the various places where we see advertisements?</strong></p>
    <p>We can see advertisements everywhere. They are printed on newspapers and magazines, painted on the wall of various buildings and on the buses running around the city, broadcasted on TVs and radios. Moreover, they are sent to us through our cell-phones and we are exposed to advertisements when we surf on the internet.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you feel about advertisements?</strong></p>
    <p>I dislike advertisements. Advertisements do offer us useful information, but most of them are to promote stuff for people to consume. I hope more space, no matter that on newspapers or walls on the buildings, be used to publicize public service advertising, advocating people to have a healthier life.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>What kinds of advertisements you like the most?</strong></p>
    <p>I like advertisements of publicizing kinds of activities, such as concerts given by singers, promotion of a well-known brand with a celebrity coming to the opening ceremony, or charity program. I appreciate the opportunities to see in person my favourite musicians and actors coming to take part in the activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Do advertisements (ever) influence your choice about what to buy?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, they do, to some extent. There are times when I waste money on things I don't need on sales, which I know from advertisements. Advertisements, however, offer me information of various brands of what I need. I tend to buy things advertised most, though I know I am charged more as the expense of advertising is added to the cost of goods.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you like advertisements on TV?</strong></p>
    <p>No, I don't like that. I am tired of wasting my time on advertisements broadcasted before or during the program I want to see. That's why I prefer to watch programs on the internet, where the amount of advertisements is less.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you prefer advertisements on TV or those in magazines?</strong></p>
    <p>I prefer advertisements on TV, which are more vivid than those in magazines. TV advertising makes full use of language, sound, words, images, action and performance, etc, to entertain people. Besides, they take up diverse forms of expression, such as telling a story to move audience, inviting a celebrity to participate, or making up a funny cartoon, by computer technology, to amuse audience, all of which leave a deeper impression on the audience.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you think is the purpose of advertisements (or advertising)?</strong></p>
    <p>As the name suggests, advertisement is a public promotion of some product or service. Advertisements are mostly used by manufacturers and companies to make their product or the service they offer known to people, which is an effective means of publicity.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you think advertising play a very important role in today's world?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, it does. Besides promoting product of service, advertising provides people a wide collection of news. For example, there are various activities held in Hangzhou every year, like the China International Animation Festival, which are on broadcast months ago before their opening date, to inform people of relevant information.</p>
    <p><strong>What sorts of advertisements leave the deepest impression on people?</strong></p>
    <p>The public service advertising impresses me most. As we know, smoking does great harm to people's health, and more people suffer form passive smoking. A public service advertising aims at this is on broadcast. A smoking man appears, followed by a woman and a child who cough badly and then fall down. It is exaggerative but does well in warning people of the danger.</p>
