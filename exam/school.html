<h4>1. Do you miss your life at school?</h4>
<p>Both yes and no. I miss those days when I didn't have to think about life at all. However, I am really glad those days have passed and I have outgrown my previous self and have become who I am now.</p>
<h4>2. Who was your favorite teacher at school?</h4>
<p>It was my English teacher, Mr.Turayev who had a deep influence on my character and future profession. he served as a role model for me and still does. we still keep in touch with him regularly.</p>
<h4>3. Do you still keep in touch with your friends from school?</h4>
<p>It's been like 8 years since I graduated from school and it remains the last time since I heard from most of my school friends. However, there are a few ones who I keep in touch with regularly.</p>
