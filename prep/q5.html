<h3>How often do you go to the cinema?</h3>
<p>A very quiet few often I go to the cinema to watch a movie. That is, once or twice a
month. For the last couple of years, due to the Corona pandemic, most of the
theatres were ideal, and people were not able to see any kind of movie.</p>
</div>

<h3>Are cinema tickets expensive in your country?</h3>
<p>Not really … I think due to unpopular use of the cinema. The tickets are moderated to
fit the pocket.</p>

<h3>What are the advantages of seeing a film at the cinema?</h3>
<p>In a cinema, you can view things that are larger and clearer enough for you to
understand what exactly they represent. This is one of the biggest advantages when
it comes to a thriller or a sci-fi movie. You would not like to miss out on the tinier
details that could ruin your cinema experience.</p>

<h3>Do you still enjoy watching the movies you loved as a child?</h3>
<p>Yes, I still love watching them so much. I won't be embarrassed to say that
from time to time I watch Disney movies like Aladdin, Peter Pan, and more.</p>
</div>
<i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que5')"></i>
<div class="que5">
<h3>Do you prefer going to cinema with friends or watching films at home?</h3>
<p>Well, I would choose the cinema with friends any time. People are so distracted from their phones; they cannot finish a movie uninterrupted at home. They won’t
be comfortable of using phones all the time in a cinema because it’s a rude thing to do.
So they can actually enjoy the movie itself a lot better! Additionally, the bigger screen
with expensive audio always make a difference!</p>
</div>

<div class="que6">
<h3>What types of movies do you like?</h3>
<p>I like all sorts of movies like thrillers, romance, action, comedy just to name a few. What I like in particular is sci-fi movies. I’m always amazed by the creativity of
those film makers not to mention the fascinating graphics!</p>

<h3>Describe an unforgettable event from your childhood?</h3>
  <p>You should say:
    <ul>
      <li>what it is</li>
       <li>when it happened</li>
       <li>how you felt at the time</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Childhood is the best time of one’s life and most of the adults want to get back on
the childhood days. I was given a novel as the first prize in my school in my early
childhood which was a happy event for me and I still remember it very vividly.</p>

<p>In my junior school, the authority held different competitions to motivate the
students into learning and attending the school. As part of the activities, they
annually organized different competitions like debates, painting, indoor sports and
more other events. I took part in a competition and got the first prize by beating
five other contestants. It was the first major success in my life and I remember it
most as it was in my early childhood (I was about seven years then and just got
promoted to the third grade in the elementary school).</p>

<p>The school authority holds the competition in the beginning of every year
(basically the first week). It is a fun to run in the cold in an open field to reach the
goals or to sit in a room with another participant and plan to beat him or her into
the indoor games. The situations are exciting for the participants but it is more
thrilling for the audience present before the spot. The authority usually arranges
the events immediately after the New Year so that everyone could join with the
events. When the events are organized during the middle the year, many of the
parents cannot attend there because they cannot manage time. Since a vacation
mode flies in the air in the first week of the New Year, the parents can have the
chance to participate.</p>

<p>Since it was the first prize of my life, it was something special for me. I was highly
glad and shouted loud in my victory. My parents were happy too as I have learnt
how to spell words from my father. Actually, he was the happiest man on this
award receiving from this Spelling Contest and my success was like the greatest
gift for him. It was also a pleasant surprise for me that I have secured the first
position in the competition by beating several other competitors and some of them were senior to me in age and class grade as well. It was really unbelievable
for me that I have succeeded in the competition.</p>

<h3>Why do people often miss their childhood?</h3>
  <p>Well, people tend to have fond memories of their childhood because these early
years in life are often carefree and exciting. They can play and have fun all day long
without having to worry too much about homework or making a living or the future.
Reminiscing about this fantastic period helps people relieve stress and cope better
with the challenges they are facing as a grownup.</p>

    <h3>Do you think kids are happier than adults?</h3>
    <p>That’s an interesting one. The way I see it, in each stage of our life from
childhood to adolescence and adulthood, we can feel content with life for
different reasons. Adults define happiness in various ways. Some might be
happy when they have a close-knit family to rely on through thick and thin or
when they’re in a wonderful relationship with their partner. Others may feel
over the moon when they are able to achieve a major goal. What I’m trying
to say is that although adults can experience several types of happiness in
their life, kids tend to feel elated more often than grownups as they haven’t
faced any adversity or struggle.</p>

<div class="que10">  
      <h3>Do you think people often stay in touch with their childhood friends?</h3>
      <p>Well,
personally I think few people manage to keep in touch with old friends from
childhood. This is mainly because they often grow apart and long distance
might make it hard to maintain a close-knit friendship, out of sight,
out of mind, you know. Added to that, as people get older, they tend to make
numerous new friends and can only take care of their current relationships.
Not to mention, they have to face all kinds of struggles in their personal life,
so they hardly have time to spend with their long-lost friends even though
they can easily reconnect on social media today.</p>

<div class="que11">  
        <h3>Is it important to have beautiful childhood memories?</h3>
<p>Absolutely, fond memories of childhood might pave the way for a balanced
and fulfilling life. It’s fair to say that what children experience during these
formative years can define their future. People with stable upbringing tend to
be more self-assured, which is the key to significant accomplishments.
Children who have gone through a traumatic childhood, on the other hand,
are more likely to have trouble later in life, like developing antisocial
behaviors or committing crime.</p>

<div class="que12">  
        <h3>What is more important for a child’s happiness, many toys or many friends?</h3>
        <p>A child needs both the toys and friends to become happy in his or her life, but
they certainly don’t need “many” of either of them. Contrary to popular belief, I
really like to think that children are “rational”, and they don’t exactly care to
understand the complicated issue of “being happy”. Rather, all the children
care is to “enjoy and have fun” in their lives whether they get them from
playing with their friends or by playing with their toys.</p>
