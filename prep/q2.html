<h3>Do you like watching TV?</h3>
<p>I don't get time really to watch television and I don't like the fact that you have no choice about what to watch, so no I would say I don't really like watching normal television, I much prefer streaming something on my iPad and watching it when I like.</p>
</div>
<i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que2')"></i>
<div class="que2">
<h3>How often do you watch TV?</h3>
<p>I don’t really watch television that often unless I want to know about some specific news or incidents, mainly because I have to stay occupied with my office works and other things most of the times, which are more important to me and my family than watching the television.</p>
</div>
<i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que3')"></i>
<div class="que3">
<h3>What kind of TV programs do you like to watch?</h3>
<p>Well, I'm interested in watching TV drama series and reality shows. I feel they are a good source of entertainment, giving people minutes of relaxation after a stressful day.</p>
</div>
<i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que4')"></i>
<div class="que4">
<h3>What’s your favorite TV program?</h3>
<p>There are many documentaries on TV related to architecture. Because I’m an architect. And they always introduce some new approaches to construction and the latest materials which can be used. I used to read book books. But now there are so many good videos online. I think they are more interesting and better.</p>
</div>
<i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que5')"></i>
<div class="que5">
<h3>Do you ever watch foreign programs or films?</h3>
<p>I did enjoy quite a lot of shows and programs, from music, movies, fashion, news and scientific documentaries since the foreign are so good at visual editing and content management. Most of them are in English because I’m more familiar with this language compares to French or Japanese.</p>

<h3>Has television changed your life in any way?</h3>
<p>I think watching TV has become a habit that I would hardly change. My family always watch the news while having dinner together. Personally, I’d love watching TV for relaxing after studying as well as keeping myself updated on show-business, music, movies, landscape discoveries and fields of science. Thus as long as I do not become a couch potato, TV has always played an important role in my life, making my life more colorful and opening in front of my eyes the places I’ve never been to.</p>

<h3>Describe an advertisement that persuaded you to buy a product</h3>
  <p>You should say:
    <ul>
      <li>What advertisement it was</li>
       <li>Was it shown on TV, radio or newspaper</li>
       <li>What was good about that advertisement</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In my opinion, most of the advertisements are merely a waste of time as they do
not actually do any good for the common people. However, there was one
advertisement that I suddenly came across, which persuaded me to think
  otherwise.</p>
<p>It is an advertisement about drinking tea. I came across such good content after a
very long time. In my opinion, it was the best advertisement that I have seen so far.
I think like that because it was created in a very realistic way to convey an
understandable message through some conversation and simple jokes. For the
  first time, I saw this advertisement on TV a few years back.</p>
<p>In this tea advertisement, they made the set up very nicely that was giving a
pleasant vibe. The stage was flawlessly set for a wonderful evening for four
people, involving two husbands and two wives. They all were engrossed in talking
and smiling with one another while enjoying a few snacks at the same time. So it
  was time for hot tea to complete the wonderful evening.</p>
<p>So in this scene, they were zooming on the brand while they were putting sugar in
their cups. Then they noticed that one of the wives wasn't putting sugar in her tea.
She was asked then what's wrong she smiled and replied I like to keep my sugar
and husband under control.</p>
<p>Everyone started laughing at the joke and with that scene the advertisement came
to an end. It persuaded me to buy the product.</p>

<h3>What makes an advertisement effective?</h3>
  <p>There are a number of facts that makes an advertisement effective. To begin
with, the advertisement on a particular product has to be absolutely relevant and
specific on its message while also describing at the same time what exactly set
the product apart from others in terms of its benefits. Besides, for an
advertisement to be effective, the language or the wording has to be unique to the
target audience, based on their age, gender, race, culture, religion and
geographic location. Finally, the advertisement should include a clear “call for
action” such as asking to buy the product or contact.</p>
 </div>
  <i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que9')"></i>
<div class="que9">     
    <h3>What is the purpose of advertising?</h3>
    <p>For a given market segment, there are six main purposes of an
advertisement, which include informing the consumers about a certain
product and convince customers, changing the belief about a certain brand,
enhance the image of the company, point out and create a need for
products or services, generating new direct sales and announce new
products and programs. Some advertisements may also want to
demonstrate new uses for established products and send a reminder to use
an existing product.</p>
  </div>
   <i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que10')"></i>
<div class="que10">  
      <h3>How have advertisements changed since you were a child?</h3>
      <p>Advertisements have changed significantly over the years since I was a
child. For a starter, when I was a child, if I remember correctly, there were
only radio, TV and print media to show us the advertisements, but today
there are computers, smartphones, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram also
on which advertisements are being displayed continuously. We can also
see billboards, neon signs, and other vibrant and visually captivating
printed designs, that are placed at strategic locations with high volumes of
human traffic, which were not seen when I was a child.</p>
  </div>
   <i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que11')"></i>
<div class="que11">  
        <h3>Do you think that advertisements should be strictly regulated?</h3>
<p>Yes, I do think that advertisement should be strictly regulated because,
without it, misleading information on the products will keep deceiving the
customers into buying wrong and defected products. Besides, without strict
regulation, bigger companies will always have undue advantages, because
of their higher budget for advertisements, over the smaller and local
manufacturers/companies even though the products of “bigger” companies
are of inferior quality to those of smaller companies. In other words,
advertisement kills competition and gives larger companies an unfair
advantage over smaller companies.</p>
    </div>
    <i class="fas fa-volume-up" onclick="speak('div.que12')"></i>
<div class="que12">  
        <h3>How important is it for advertisers to tell the whole truth in advertisements?</h3>
        <p>It is absolutely important for advertisers to tell the whole truth in advertisements for trust issues. Advertisers should tell customers exactly what they are buying or getting because if there is a discrepancy between the expectation of the customers and what the advertisers advertise, then the trust would be lost, and the customers most likely would never come back to buy the same products again in the future. Besides, some customers may also go as far as “suing” the company, if they think that they are lied to, which certainly is not good for the lasting image of a company.</p>
