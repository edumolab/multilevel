<h3>Do you like reading books?</h3>
<p>Yes, I do! For me, reading is a must as it helps me widen my knowledge
about so many things. Besides, it's a very good way to improve my
vocabulary and creative thinking skills. Actually, I'm more into reading fiction, business, and history books.</p>

<h3>How often do you read?</h3>
<p>As soon as I wake up and before going to sleep at night, so about two
hours every day. During the day I'll read online news or magazines, and
occasionally some more from a book.</p>

<h3>Do you have many books at home?</h3>
<p>No, I don’t have many books at home, but I do like to visit the library. There
I get plenty of books according to my taste, and sometimes I like to read
online.</p>

<h3>Do others in your family read books too?</h3>
<p>Well, I think my youngest brother is the only person who read books
aside from me. He is presently a high school student and should study
his lessons by reading the academic books they use in school.</p>

<h3>How does book help us?</h3>
<p>Books help us to teach ourselves about history, the arts, science, religion,
nature, mathematics, and technology –– anything and everything in our
universe and beyond. Books also help us to understand the effect that all
those things have on us and our world. Books entertain and offer a great
escape.Books help us to teach ourselves about history, the arts, science, religion,

<h3>What's your favorite kind of book?</h3>
<p>I typically like to read novels. I'm not sure about the actual reason but it is
interesting to read about people's lives represented by some characters,
especially when they have had interesting lives and have had to deal with
many problems.</p>

<h3>Describe a book you have read?</h3>
  <p>You should say:
    <ul>
      <li>What kind book it is</li>
       <li>who wrote the book</li>
       <li>what the book is about</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The book I have recently finished and enjoyed so much is called "The Fortunate
Pilgrim", and I would like to talk about it for this topic.</p>
<p>It is a novel by Mario Puzo which was first published in the year 1965. The writer
Mario Puzo is well-known for his famous mafia book "The Godfather". He,
nevertheless, received numerous positive reviews for his book "The Fortunate
Pilgrim". The writer had developed the story of this novel based on his mother's
immigration struggling for respectability in the United States. Mario Puzo himself
considered this novel to be his finest though Godfather earned him much more
fame and earning.</p>
<p>The novel tells the story of an immigrant family living in New York City. The mother
of the family, Lucia Santa is the protagonist of it. It is her formidable will that
steers the family members through the Great Depression and early years of World
War II. The story, events, and the characters become so real that the readers can't
stop wondering about them even when they are not reading. The writer had been
able to tell an ordinary story extraordinarily. It makes us feel and relate the
characters, their happiness, sorrows and sufferings in our lives, and that's why the
characters and stories got the power to keep readers awake the whole night.
Mario Puzo has shown literacy excellence in this story and it will keep on surprising
readers in the coming decades.</p>
<p>I liked the book very much and finished it within 3 days. I have always been a great
admirer of Puzo's writing style, and "The Fortunate Pilgrim" was a bit different
from his famous mafia books. It touches the reader's mind, keeps them wondering
and tells them an amazing story. So, I had every valid reason to enjoy this book to a
great extent.</p>

<h3>Do you generally read a lot of books or do you prefer watching TV? Why?</h3>
  <p>I prefer reading books over enjoying random programs on television. However,
that does not mean that I hate watching TV. I just feel that reading is a far better
habit than watching TV. Every book gives us the opportunity to learn something
new and the time spent on reading a book is more constructive. I can’t say the
same for the TV. We often watch TV to kill our time and end up surfing through
channels rather than watching something meaningful.</p>

    <h3>What kind of books are considered good reads in your opinion?</h3>
    <p>I believe books that are suitable for a reader’s age and do not contain any hate
speech or offensive materials are a good choice. Generally speaking, if a book can
grab readers’ interest, makes them think, or helps them learn something new then
it is a good read. For me, a captivating story and character development in it are
always key indicators for a good read. However, I often enjoy books simply
because they are educative and are based on real events.</p>

      <h3>Do you think that people read nowadays as they did in the past?</h3>
      <p>I believe we always had readers in our society and we still have who enjoys
reading books more than any other activity. However, the way people read in the
past has changed. We now have digital devices to read books and the Internet to
download and read any book we like. These days the young generation seems
more interested in technology than books but as I have said, we still have a good
number of readers who use the technology to read books of their favorite writers.
Online platforms also enable us to express ourselves about a writer and his/her
books more openly.</p>

        <h3>Do you regard famous writers as good role models?</h3>
<p>If we consider famous writers in general, they are better role models for us than
many politicians, celebrities and athletes. However, we should follow them through
their writings, their contribution to society and their good deeds, not the few who
set bad examples in their personal life. Writers have always inspired us and they
still do in numerous ways. So if we consider famous writers as our role models, we
will have more to gain than to lose.</p>

        <h3>If a movie is based on a book, would you prefer to read the book or to watch
the film? Why?</h3>
        <p>I would not mind both reading the book and watching the movie. However, my
personal experience has taught me that books are better than movies in most of
the cases. To many, watching a movie is more exciting, and interesting visual
effects of the film make it more appealing. However, books can touch a reader
more profoundly than the movie. While movies can bring whole worlds to life
before our eyes, make characters into living, books ignite our imagination and take
us to a world unknown to us and the journey allows us to feel every experience of
the characters, thus leaving a lasting impression in our memory. So, I might skip
watching a few good films based on books but would not want to miss those
books.</p>
