<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Are there any environmental problems in your country?</p>
<p class="p2">Kelly: Yes … we have a serious issue with <span class="s1"><strong>pollution levels </strong></span>in some of our big cities … <span class="s1"><strong>exhaust fumes </strong></span>from cars and lorries are definitely one reason for the problem but we also have a lot of <span class="s1"><strong>heavy industry </strong></span>in some areas and this also results in poor <span class="s1"><strong>air quality </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you take an interest in nature?</p>
<p class="p2">Jenny: Well … I’m a city person through and through and don’t <span class="s1"><strong>get back to nature </strong></span>very often I’m afraid … but like everyone else I’m fascinated by <span class="s1"><strong>the natural world </strong></span>and I like watching documentaries showing wild animals in their <span class="s1"><strong>natural habitat </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you or your family take steps to help the environment?</p>
<p class="p1">Mira: My parents have always tried to make us aware of our <span class="s1"><strong>impact on the environment</strong></span>… they’re really into <span class="s1"><strong>energy conservation </strong></span>… and always try to buy <span class="s1"><strong>environmentally friendly</strong></span>products if they have the chance …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe an environmental problem that has been in the news. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">When this was</li>
<li class="p3">Where the event happened</li>
<li class="p2">What actually took place</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say how you felt about this problem.</p>
<p class="p1">Martin: Well … this is an interesting question … there are so many issues I could think of … <span class="s1"><strong>natural disasters </strong></span>like earthquakes and floods seem to be in the news almost every year … but there was one story recently about some animals that were <span class="s1"><strong>under threat </strong></span>… it wasn’t focused on one place in particular … it was looking at various animals that could actually <span class="s1"><strong>become extinct </strong></span>in different African countries … if we don’t take steps to protect them … these were really iconic animals like gorillas … leopards … rhinos … and apparently they’re now listed as <span class="s1"><strong>endangered species </strong></span>… what made it really depressing was they were in danger thanks to us … in some cases it was due to a <span class="s1"><strong>loss of habitat </strong></span>either because people need more agricultural production … or even worse I think … because of hunting and <span class="s1"><strong>poaching </strong></span>… I hate to think of <span class="s1"><strong>future generations </strong></span>being robbed of the chance to see creatures like these in their <span class="s1"><strong>natural environment </strong></span>… it’s lucky we have lots of organisations that focus on <span class="s1"><strong>wildlife conservation </strong></span>… hopefully with their help we can put pressure on those in power to do something to stop creatures like these <span class="s1"><strong>dying out </strong></span>…</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What do you think is the main danger the world faces in terms of the environment?</p>
<p class="p1">Spencer: Well … <span class="s1"><strong>climate change </strong></span>is a real issue … in my country we have <span class="s1"><strong>flash floods </strong></span>and heatwaves on a yearly basis … so yes … I think <span class="s1"><strong>global warming </strong></span>is the biggest issue.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What examples are there of how we damage the natural world?</p>
<p class="p1">Stella: There are so many examples … there are factories that empty <span class="s1"><strong>toxic waste </strong></span>into rivers and oceans … <span class="s1"><strong>oil spills </strong></span>that damage the coastline … the way we destroy vast areas of land and rain forests in search of <span class="s1"><strong>fossil fuels </strong></span>or to increase agricultural production …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: In which ways do we respond well to environmental problems?</p>
<p class="p1">Mathius: Well … on the one hand there are various worldwide agencies that are always the first on the scene with <span class="s1"><strong>humanitarian aid </strong></span>after natural and <span class="s1"><strong>man-made disasters </strong></span>… and on the other hand we have environmental <span class="s1"><strong>pressure groups </strong></span>that are constantly raising awareness of issues and trying to stop disasters happening …</p>
