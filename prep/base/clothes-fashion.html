<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you enjoy buying clothes?</p>
<p class="p2">Pedro: I used to … yes … like most young people I was a bit of <span class="s1"><strong>a slave to fashion </strong></span>and I’d always have to buy that <span class="s1"><strong>must-have </strong></span>shirt or pair of shoes … I’m not so bothered now though … I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing something <span class="s1"><strong>old fashioned </strong></span>but I’m not as bothered as I used to be about what I wear …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What kind of clothes do you like to wear?</p>
<p class="p2">Marco: I prefer <span class="s1"><strong>casual clothes </strong></span>actually … I hate <span class="s1"><strong>getting dressed up </strong></span>for special occasions … personally I think it’s possible <span class="s1"><strong>to look good in </strong></span>a pair of jeans … but that’s my opinion … I don’t think my wife would call me a <span class="s1"><strong>fashion icon </strong></span>that’s for sure …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Are there many clothes shops where you live?</p>
<p class="p1">Sylvia: Yes … there are lots in my town … apart from the big chain stores we’ve got a couple of really nice shops that sell <span class="s1"><strong>vintage clothes </strong></span>… old clothes but in a <span class="s1"><strong>classic style </strong></span>that never really <span class="s1"><strong>go out of fashion </strong></span>… I love going there …</p>

<li class="p3">How you know them</li>
<li class="p2">What kind of clothes they wear</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you like the way they dress.</p>
<p class="p1">Tomoko: I’d like to talk about one of my teachers … Miss Evans … she teaches us English in the school I go to … we always look forward to seeing what she’s going to wear when our lessons start … she’s always very <span class="s1"><strong>well dressed </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>takes a lot of pride in her appearance </strong></span>… it’s not that she dresses in very <span class="s1"><strong>smart clothes </strong></span>… she doesn’t come to school <span class="s1"><strong>dressed to kill </strong></span>or anything like that … but what she wears really <span class="s1"><strong>suits her </strong></span>… and she has a great <span class="s1"><strong>sense of style </strong></span>as well … we often ask her where she gets some of her clothes and most of the time they’re just <span class="s1"><strong>off the peg </strong></span>… and she says she’s not interested in <span class="s1"><strong>designer labels </strong></span>or anything like that … she doesn’t seem too concerned about <span class="s1"><strong>keeping up with the latest fashion </strong></span>… she just wears clothes that are <span class="s1"><strong>timeless </strong></span>… yes … Miss Evans is the person I think looks great in the clothes she wears …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What factors do you think affect the clothes we choose to wear?</p>
<p class="p1">Maki: It depends … where we are or where we’re going is a big factor … if you are going out to a club or party you’re going <span class="s1"><strong>to dress for the occasion </strong></span>… and then there are those who think it’s important to look like they’re <span class="s1"><strong>on trend </strong></span>… they’ll want to wear the latest fashions … there are lots of factors really …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What kind of things determine what is in fashion and what we should be wearing?</p>
<p class="p1">Martin: I suppose the big <span class="s1"><strong>fashion houses </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>fashion shows </strong></span>must have an effect but the clothes you see <span class="s1"><strong>on the catwalk </strong></span>don’t always reflect what normal people wear … so I suppose it will be things like what singers are wearing in videos or models are wearing in magazines … that kind of thing …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is it possible to look good without spending lots of money on clothes?</p>
<p class="p1">Corinna: I’m sure it is … yes … I suppose it’s about <span class="s1"><strong>having an eye for </strong></span>what looks good … knowing how <span class="s1"><strong>to mix and match </strong></span>different items of clothing that go well together … I think you can pick up great bargains in charity shops … sometimes for youngsters even <span class="s1"><strong>hand-me-downs </strong></span>can look good …</p>
