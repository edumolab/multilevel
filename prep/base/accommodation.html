<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you live in a house or an apartment?</p>
<p class="p2">Callum: Actually I live <span class="s1"><strong>on campus </strong></span>… in a <span class="s1"><strong>single room </strong></span>in <span class="s1"><strong>halls of residence </strong></span>… all first year students are encouraged to do that as they’re close to the university … next year I plan to move into <span class="s1"><strong>student digs </strong></span>in town …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Tell me about where you live.</p>
<p class="p2">Julia: I live with my parents <span class="s1"><strong>in the suburbs </strong></span>of Madrid … we only <span class="s1"><strong>moved in </strong></span>recently … in fact we had a <span class="s1"><strong>house-warming party </strong></span>just a few weeks ago …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What kind of accommodation do most people live in in your city?</p>
<p class="p2">Maria: In the city itself the majority of people live in <span class="s1"><strong>apartment blocks </strong></span>… that’s what surprised me about England … most people seem to live in <span class="s1"><strong>terraced houses </strong></span>with lovely <span class="s1"><strong>back gardens </strong></span>…</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a house or an apartment you would like to live in. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">What kind of accommodation it would be</li>
<li class="p3">Where it would be</li>
<li class="p2">Who would live there with you</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you would enjoy living in this place.</p>
<p class="p1">Paolo: I think most people when answering this question would say they’d like to live in a big <span class="s1"><strong>detached house </strong></span>with <span class="s1"><strong>spacious rooms </strong></span>… views of the countryside and so on … but actually my <span class="s1"><strong>ideal home </strong></span>would be a lot different … I’ve always loved the idea of having a <span class="s1"><strong>mobile home </strong></span>… a really expensive one with <span class="s1"><strong>all the mod cons </strong></span>… so I could live wherever I wanted or at least have lots of holidays and be able to take all my <span class="s1"><strong>home comforts </strong></span>with me whenever I travelled … I realise this would have to be a second home as I’d need a base … a <span class="s1"><strong>permanent address </strong></span>… but the mobile home would be the accommodation I’d find it exciting to live in … I suppose once I settle down and have children I’ll want <span class="s1"><strong>to get on the property ladder </strong></span>… I’ll be like everyone else … saving up <span class="s1"><strong>to put down a deposit </strong></span>on a house or an apartment … I don’t think my family would want to live in a mobile home … but I like to think I’ll still keep that <span class="s1"><strong>dream home </strong></span>in mind …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is it better to own your own home or to rent?</p>
<p class="p1">Ana: I think both have their advantages … living in <span class="s1"><strong>rented accommodation </strong></span>isn’t necessarily a bad thing … you don’t have a huge debt like you do when you <span class="s1"><strong>take out a mortgage </strong></span>but I suppose the <span class="s1"><strong>property market </strong></span>offers you an investment for the future … I’m sure that’s why most people prefer <span class="s1"><strong>to own their own home </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What options are available to young couples looking for accommodation in your country?</p>
<p class="p1">Toni: If they want to buy their own home it isn’t easy for <span class="s1"><strong>first-time buyers </strong></span>… mortgages are hard to get so most people live with their parents or in <span class="s1"><strong>rented accommodation </strong></span>… but that can also be very expensive … you often have to <span class="s1"><strong>pay </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>rent in advance </strong></span>… and if the accommodation isn’t <span class="s1"><strong>fully furnished </strong></span>you have the expense of buying furniture …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are some of the pleasures involved in making a home for ourselves?</p>
<p class="p1">Suki: I suppose it starts with <span class="s1"><strong>house-hunting </strong></span>… finding your ideal home … some people enjoy <span class="s1"><strong>doing up an old property </strong></span>… giving a property that’s old and tired a new lease of life … others like making wherever they live feel like home with some <span class="s1"><strong>home comforts </strong></span>…</p>
