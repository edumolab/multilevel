<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What is it like where you live?</p>
<p class="p2">Christiane: I live in a <span class="s1"><strong>residential area </strong></span>of a busy town in the south of Spain … we have all the facilities you need … good <span class="s1"><strong>public transport </strong></span>… a good <span class="s1"><strong>shopping centre </strong></span>… it’s nice …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you like living in the city?</p>
<p class="p2">Andrea: Yes I do … I like going out with my friends and there are lots of <span class="s1"><strong>lively bars and restaurants </strong></span>within walking distance of my apartment … I’m a bit of a culture vulture as well so it’s great to have access to art exhibitions and that kind of thing …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you get many tourists visiting your area?</p>
<p class="p1">Mandy: Not really no … I live in the <span class="s1"><strong>inner-city </strong></span>and the area is a little <span class="s1"><strong>run down </strong></span>… it’s basically a lot of <span class="s1"><strong>high-rise flats </strong></span>and many of the shops are <span class="s1"><strong>boarded up </strong></span>… so nothing to interest tourists really …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe an interesting town or city in your country that visitors might enjoy. You should say</p>

<li class="p3">Where the place is</li>
<li class="p2">What the facilities are like</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why visitors might enjoy going there.</p>
<p class="p1">Monique: Anyone who comes to my country really should spend some time in Barcelona … it’s a beautiful place … it’s not what you would call a <span class="s1"><strong>sprawling city </strong></span>… it’s quite compact really and you could walk across the city in a couple of hours … but there’s no need to do that as we have a fantastic <span class="s1"><strong>public transport system </strong></span>so it’s easy <span class="s1"><strong>to get around </strong></span>… there are various districts all with their own character … you have the <span class="s1"><strong>upmarket shops </strong></span>in the centre … you’ll find lots of <span class="s1"><strong>chain stores </strong></span>you’ll recognise from your own country but also local brands as well … we have the narrow streets in the Gothic district with lots of <span class="s1"><strong>fashionable boutiques </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>tourist attractions </strong></span>… there’s the Olympic area and the beaches along the coast … and dotted around the city are some lovely <span class="s1"><strong>public spaces </strong></span>… parks and squares in the <span class="s1"><strong>city centre </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>on the outskirts </strong></span>of Barcelona where people relax with their friends and family … and of course <span class="s1"><strong>pavement cafes </strong></span>everywhere … all that and some great historical <span class="s1"><strong>places of interest </strong></span>… so a great destination for tourists …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are the advantages of living in a city or big town?</p>
<p class="p1">Carrie: I think it’s having access to <span class="s1"><strong>local facilities </strong></span>really … local shops as well as access to larger <span class="s1"><strong>shopping malls </strong></span>in the city centre … and if you’re well-off you can afford to live <span class="s1"><strong>in the suburbs</strong></span>away from the busy traffic …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: In your experience are city centres usually attractive places?</p>
<p class="p1">Mary: Some can be yes … especially those with a historical interest … but sometimes they’re full of ugly <span class="s1"><strong>office blocks </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>multi-story car parks </strong></span>… and residents living in <span class="s1"><strong>poor housing </strong></span>… it depends on the city doesn’t it?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are some of the challenges facing towns and cities?</p>
<p class="p1">Penny: I suppose <span class="s1"><strong>traffic congestion </strong></span>is a major problem … and the growth in <span class="s1"><strong>out-of-town supermarkets and retail parks </strong></span>mean lots of town centre shops are <span class="s1"><strong>closing down </strong></span>… plus a shortage of good quality housing … I think these are the major challenges …</p>
