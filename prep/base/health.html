Read the following IELTS-style questions and answers below and pay attention to the phrases in <span class="s1"><b>bold</b></span>. Use the ‘Definitions’ section at the bottom of the page to check the meaning of any phrases you don’t understand.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Have you got a relation you’re particularly fond of? Sinita: Yes … my granddad … he’s 94 years old but generally he’s <span class="s1"><b>as fit as a fiddle </b></span>… we’re very close and see each other a lot … whenever he <span class="s1"><b>goes down with a cold </b></span>or <span class="s1"><b>is under the weather </b></span>I make a point of visiting him …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you do any sport? Jon: Yes … I’m keen on skateboarding … but I haven’t done it for a while … I had a bad fall recently and <span class="s1"><b>pulled a muscle </b></span>and had a few <span class="s1"><b>cuts and bruises </b></span>… but I’m <span class="s1"><b>on the mend </b></span>and hope to be doing it again soon …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is there anything you’re particularly afraid of? Davide: The dentist … I hate going to the dentist … I only ever go if I <span class="s1"><b>have a toothache </b></span>so it usually means I have to <span class="s1"><b>have a filling </b></span>or even <span class="s1"><b>have a tooth out </b></span>… I really don’t like it …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a time when you were ill. You should say:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">When this was</li>
<li class="p3">What your symptoms were</li>
<li class="p2">How long the illness lasted</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say how it affected your life at the time.</p>
<p class="p1">Pierre: This is a tricky one really as I’m usually quite healthy … I’ve never been seriously ill … like everyone else I sometimes get a few <span class="s1"><b>aches and pains </b></span>or <span class="s1"><b>catch a cold </b></span>… I can remember a few months ago I had to have time off work with <span class="s1"><b>a heavy cold </b></span>… I had the usual symptoms … <span class="s1"><b>a blocked nose </b></span>… <span class="s1"><b>sore throat </b></span>… it lasted quite a while … about 2 weeks I think though I didn’t have that much time off work … for a few days I remember <span class="s1"><b>feeling poorly </b></span>but I was <span class="s1"><b>over the worst of it</b></span>after a few days and went back to work … I always find it’s better to be active when you feel ill as it keeps your mind off your symptoms … I think my family get a little fed up with me when I’m ill though … I tend to feel sorry for myself and lie on the sofa all day as if I’<span class="s1"><b>m at death’s door </b></span>… but as I said earlier … on this occasion it was nothing serious and didn’t really cause me any problems …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What costs are involved when you are ill in your country? Anya: Well … people have to pay <span class="s1"><b>prescription charges </b></span>which can be quite expensive … but fortunately general healthcare is free … unless you want to <span class="s1"><b>go private </b></span>of course and then you can pay a fortune for your treatment …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: In your experience are people too quick to take time off work when they’re ill?</p>
<p class="p1">Alicia: Yes .. I’ve got friends who have a day off work if they wake up with a <span class="s1"><b>runny nose </b></span>… and in most cases they seem <span class="s1"><b>to make a speedy recovery </b></span>after they’ve <span class="s1"><b>phoned in sick </b></span>…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do women pay more attention to their health than men? Julie: I think so yes … women are more likely to see their <span class="s1"><b>GP </b></span>for a <span class="s1"><b>check-up </b></span>if they’re concerned about something … men tend to avoid facing up to any health problems they have … my dad always seems to have a very <span class="s1"><b>chesty cough </b></span>but refuses to go to <span class="s1"><b>make an appointment </b></span>to see the doctor …</p>
