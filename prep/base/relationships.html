<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you see your friends very often? Louisa: Yes … we meet up most weekends … we all <span class="s1"><strong>get on really well </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>have a lot in common </strong></span>so we’re always happy doing the same things and going to the same places.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What do you like about your close friends? Anna: I think we <span class="s1"><strong>enjoy each other’s company </strong></span>… we <span class="s1"><strong>see eye-to-eye on </strong></span>most things so we rarely <span class="s1"><strong>fall out with </strong></span>each other.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Have you known each other long? Amy: Most of them yes … although my closest friend Carrie … we <span class="s1"><strong>struck up a relationship </strong></span>at college and <span class="s1"><strong>got on like a house on fire </strong></span>… but yes … my other friendships <span class="s1"><strong>go back years </strong></span>to when we were at school.</p>

<p class="p4">Reiko: I’d like to talk about my boyfriend … Jose … we <span class="s2"><strong>got to know </strong></span>each other at University almost 4 years ago … we were in the same department … initially we were <span class="s2"><strong>just good friends </strong></span>and used to go out in a group with our other friends … when Jose went back to Spain for the holidays we would <span class="s2"><strong>keep in touch with </strong></span>each other … then one year he invited me to come to Spain with him … and that’s when we <span class="s2"><strong>fell for </strong></span>each other I think … so you couldn’t really say it was <span class="s2"><strong>love at first sight </strong></span>as it had been over a year since we’d met … but we really <span class="s2"><strong>hit it off </strong></span>and by the time we got back to university in September we were able to tell all our friends that we were <span class="s2"><strong>in a relationship</strong></span>… what do I like about Jose … well he’s very kind … very funny … and very supportive … and we’re really <span class="s2"><strong>well matched </strong></span>in our interests … he hasn’t <span class="s2"><strong>popped the question </strong></span>yet though … we’ve talked about getting married and I think we’re both ready <span class="s2"><strong>to settle down </strong></span>and have children … we’ll just have to wait and see …</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p4">Examiner: Do you think marriage is still as important as ever? Cristine: Yes … it certainly is in my country … I think the problem for some people is a lack of commitment … all relationships <span class="s2"><strong>have their ups and downs </strong></span>…. but some people prefer to <span class="s2"><strong>break up</strong></span>rather than <span class="s2"><strong>working at </strong></span>the relationship.</p>
<p class="p4">Examiner: What do you think is the ideal time to get married? Terry: Personally … I think you should wait until you’ve found yourself first … decided if you want a career … perhaps do some travelling … you should do this before <span class="s2"><strong>tying the knot </strong></span>… although if you <span class="s2"><strong>fall head over heels in love </strong></span>plans like these can easily be forgotten.</p>
<p class="p4">Examiner: Is it important to keep in contact with our friends when we’re in a relationship? Maria: Absolutely … it’s so easy to <span class="s2"><strong>drift apart </strong></span>from your friends when you <span class="s2"><strong>fall in </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>love </strong></span>… but I think both partners should try not <span class="s1"><strong>to lose touch with </strong></span>their friends … that’s the best way to have a <span class="s1"><strong>healthy relationship </strong></span>with your partner.</p>
