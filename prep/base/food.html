<p class="p1">Read the following IELTS-style questions and answers below and pay attention to the phrases in <span class="s1"><strong>bold</strong></span>. Use the ‘Definitions’ section at the bottom of the page to check the meaning of any phrases you don’t understand.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you like to cook? Mandy: Not really no … most of the time I eat <span class="s1"><strong>ready meals </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>take-aways </strong></span>… that’s one of the reasons I love visiting my mum … you can always guarantee lovely <span class="s1"><strong>home-cooked food </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What time do you usually eat dinner? Michelle: We have our <span class="s1"><strong>main meal </strong></span>at around 7.00 … I’m usually <span class="s1"><strong>starving hungry </strong></span>by then … in fact I often <span class="s1"><strong>grab a bite to eat </strong></span>as soon as I get home from college … a sandwich perhaps … but not too much <span class="s1"><strong>to spoil my appetite </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Are there any types of food you don’t like? Lionel: No not really … I’m not <span class="s1"><strong>a fussy eater </strong></span>at all … actually I <span class="s1"><strong>eat like a horse </strong></span>… I do a lot of sport and <span class="s1"><strong>work up quite an appetite </strong></span>…</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a restaurant that you like to use. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">Where this restaurant is</li>
<li class="p3">What kind of food it serves</li>
<li class="p2">How often you go there</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you like eating there so much.</p>
<p class="p1">Howard: OK … this is a nice topic to talk about … there’s a restaurant just around the corner from where I live … it’s an Italian restaurant so as you’d expect you can eat various pasta dishes and pizzas and I usually go there with my family for <span class="s1"><strong>a slap-up meal </strong></span>if we have anything to celebrate … it’s quite a posh restaurant … the kind of place you would take someone if you wanted <span class="s1"><strong>to wine and dine </strong></span>them … we usually order <span class="s1"><strong>a 3-course meal </strong></span>… a light starter then a main dish … and I have quite <span class="s1"><strong>a sweet tooth </strong></span>so I always look forward to the dessert … I usually order Tiramisu … it <span class="s1"><strong>makes my mouth water </strong></span>just to think about it … I’m always totally <span class="s1"><strong>full up </strong></span>by the end … why do I enjoy it there … well … it’s not cheap … my parents always <span class="s1"><strong>foot the bill </strong></span>and we couldn’t afford to go there regularly so it’s always a nice treat …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Examiner: How can we encourage people to eat more healthily? Anna: I think the best approach is to have everything in moderation … <span class="s1"><strong>processed food </strong></span>won’t kill you if you only eat it occasionally … but people should also be encouraged <span class="s1"><strong>to eat a balanced diet</strong></span>… try to cook fresh ingredients at home a few times a week …</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Do you think people enjoy their food as much as they should? Florrie: I don’t know really … I suppose it’s true that people will often eat <span class="s1"><strong>a quick snack </strong></span>because they’re bored not because they’re <span class="s1"><strong>dying of hunger </strong></span>… and often they just <strong>bolt it down </strong>and don’t savour it … so yes … perhaps we could take more time over our food …</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Do you think cooking is a pleasure or a chore for people who have busy lives? Julie: Well … whether you <span class="s1"><strong>follow a recipe </strong></span>or make something up as you go along … I think cooking is a very creative process … and cooking for other people is a particular pleasure … there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing people you love <span class="s1"><strong>tucking into </strong></span>something you’ve cooked yourself …</p>
