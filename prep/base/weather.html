<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What’s the weather like in your country?</p>
<p class="p2">Katie: It’s quite <span class="s1"><strong>changeable </strong></span>really … we have periods of time with <span class="s1"><strong>clear blue skies </strong></span>then all of a sudden we’ll have <span class="s1"><strong>torrential rain. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Which months have the best weather in your country?</p>
<p class="p2">Ernst: Well … I suppose it’s a matter of personal taste really … I like it around the end of October and November … I’m not fond of the <span class="s1"><strong>heatwaves </strong></span>we often get during the summer … it’s not <span class="s1"><strong>freezing cold </strong></span>during these months and we still get lots of <span class="s1"><strong>sunny spells. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Does it bother you much when it rains?</p>
<p class="p1">Junko: It depends … if I <span class="s1"><strong>get caught in the rain </strong></span>and I <span class="s1"><strong>get drenched </strong></span>I don’t like it … but I’m a gardener so <span class="s1"><strong>a drop of rain </strong></span>is good for my plants.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a time when you experienced extreme weather conditions. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">When this was</li>
<li class="p3">Where you were</li>
<li class="p2">What the weather was like</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say how you felt about the experience.</p>
<p class="p1">I was studying English in a language school a few years ago … we were in Cornwall in the UK … we’d been enjoying lovely sunny days … <span class="s1"><strong>not a cloud in the sky </strong></span>… when all of a sudden there was <span class="s1"><strong>a change in the weather </strong></span>… we were in town walking around the shops when it started <span class="s1"><strong>to pour down </strong></span>… I’d never seen such <span class="s1"><strong>heavy rain </strong></span>before … within about 10 minutes the roads were full of water … I think they call it a <span class="s1"><strong>flash flood </strong></span>… it was like being in the middle of a <span class="s1"><strong>tropical storm </strong></span>… the water was almost up to my knees … the <span class="s1"><strong>weather forecast </strong></span>hadn’t predicted it so everyone was taken by surprise … I’m not sure you could call it ‘extreme’ weather as a few hours later it started <span class="s1"><strong>to clear up </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>the sun came out </strong></span>and slowly the water level went down … but a lot of people’s houses were flooded so it would have been extreme for them … I found it all quite exciting … in my country we generally have a very <span class="s1"><strong>mild climate </strong></span>and don’t often get floods like this so it was quite an experience for me.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you think the weather affects how people feel?</p>
<p class="p1">Tierre: Absolutely … yes … I don’t mind the occasional <span class="s1"><strong>cold spell </strong></span>but I think the winter months can make you feel down. I hate having to leave the house in the winter … there’s often a <span class="s1"><strong>thick fog</strong></span>every morning and we sometimes get <span class="s1"><strong>bitterly </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>cold </strong></span>winds … the winter certainly makes me feel a little depressed … though having said that … it’s always nice to see the town covered in a <span class="s1"><strong>blanket of snow. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you think the weather is changing due to global warming?</p>
<p class="p1">Ceri: I don’t know if it’s due to global warming or not but the weather in my country is certainly changing … we’ve been getting quite <span class="s1"><strong>mild winters </strong></span>lately … the temperatures are sometimes <span class="s1"><strong>below freezing </strong></span>but only occasionally … and then during the summer it can get <span class="s1"><strong>boiling hot </strong></span>with a lot of older people even suffering from <span class="s1"><strong>heatstroke</strong></span>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: In which ways are weather forecasts useful?</p>
<p class="p1">Sinita: Well … if you’re planning a trip or going on holiday it’s important to know whether you’ll need to <span class="s1"><strong>dress up warm </strong></span>or take an umbrella … farmers need to know what the <span class="s1"><strong>long-range forecast </strong></span>is so they can plan their work … I suppose people who organise outside events need to know as well in case things get <span class="s1"><strong>rained off</strong></span>.</p>
