		<p class="p1">In the IELTS Speaking exam you may be asked questions about the topic of ‘the weather’, perhaps the weather in your country or when you’ve travelled to other countries. Read the following IELTS-style questions and answers below and pay attention to the phrases in <span class="s1"><strong>bold</strong></span>. Use the ‘Definitions’ section at the bottom of the page to check the meaning of any phrases you don’t understand.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What’s the weather like in your country?</p>
<p class="p2">Katie: It’s quite <span class="s1"><strong>changeable </strong></span>really … we have periods of time with <span class="s1"><strong>clear blue skies </strong></span>then all of a sudden we’ll have <span class="s1"><strong>torrential rain. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Which months have the best weather in your country?</p>
<p class="p2">Ernst: Well … I suppose it’s a matter of personal taste really … I like it around the end of October and November … I’m not fond of the <span class="s1"><strong>heatwaves </strong></span>we often get during the summer … it’s not <span class="s1"><strong>freezing cold </strong></span>during these months and we still get lots of <span class="s1"><strong>sunny spells. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Does it bother you much when it rains?</p>
<p class="p1">Junko: It depends … if I <span class="s1"><strong>get caught in the rain </strong></span>and I <span class="s1"><strong>get drenched </strong></span>I don’t like it … but I’m a gardener so <span class="s1"><strong>a drop of rain </strong></span>is good for my plants.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a time when you experienced extreme weather conditions. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">When this was</li>
<li class="p3">Where you were</li>
<li class="p2">What the weather was like</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say how you felt about the experience.</p>
<p class="p1">I was studying English in a language school a few years ago … we were in Cornwall in the UK … we’d been enjoying lovely sunny days … <span class="s1"><strong>not a cloud in the sky </strong></span>… when all of a sudden there was <span class="s1"><strong>a change in the weather </strong></span>… we were in town walking around the shops when it started <span class="s1"><strong>to pour down </strong></span>… I’d never seen such <span class="s1"><strong>heavy rain </strong></span>before … within about 10 minutes the roads were full of water … I think they call it a <span class="s1"><strong>flash flood </strong></span>… it was like being in the middle of a <span class="s1"><strong>tropical storm </strong></span>… the water was almost up to my knees … the <span class="s1"><strong>weather forecast </strong></span>hadn’t predicted it so everyone was taken by surprise … I’m not sure you could call it ‘extreme’ weather as a few hours later it started <span class="s1"><strong>to clear up </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>the sun came out </strong></span>and slowly the water level went down … but a lot of people’s houses were flooded so it would have been extreme for them … I found it all quite exciting … in my country we generally have a very <span class="s1"><strong>mild climate </strong></span>and don’t often get floods like this so it was quite an experience for me.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you think the weather affects how people feel?</p>
<p class="p1">Tierre: Absolutely … yes … I don’t mind the occasional <span class="s1"><strong>cold spell </strong></span>but I think the winter months can make you feel down. I hate having to leave the house in the winter … there’s often a <span class="s1"><strong>thick fog</strong></span>every morning and we sometimes get <span class="s1"><strong>bitterly </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>cold </strong></span>winds … the winter certainly makes me feel a little depressed … though having said that … it’s always nice to see the town covered in a <span class="s1"><strong>blanket of snow. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you think the weather is changing due to global warming?</p>
<p class="p1">Ceri: I don’t know if it’s due to global warming or not but the weather in my country is certainly changing … we’ve been getting quite <span class="s1"><strong>mild winters </strong></span>lately … the temperatures are sometimes <span class="s1"><strong>below freezing </strong></span>but only occasionally … and then during the summer it can get <span class="s1"><strong>boiling hot </strong></span>with a lot of older people even suffering from <span class="s1"><strong>heatstroke</strong></span>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: In which ways are weather forecasts useful?</p>
<p class="p1">Sinita: Well … if you’re planning a trip or going on holiday it’s important to know whether you’ll need to <span class="s1"><strong>dress up warm </strong></span>or take an umbrella … farmers need to know what the <span class="s1"><strong>long-range forecast </strong></span>is so they can plan their work … I suppose people who organise outside events need to know as well in case things get <span class="s1"><strong>rained off</strong></span>.</p>
