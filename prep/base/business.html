<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you work or are you a student?</p>
<p class="p2">Hati: I <span class="s1"><strong>run my own business </strong></span>actually … I have an online business selling cosmetics … I <span class="s1"><strong>set up the business </strong></span>5 years ago and I’m really enjoying <span class="s1"><strong>working for myself </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What is your ideal job?</p>
<p class="p2">Kaori: I don’t think I’d enjoy working for a big company … I think I’d like <span class="s1"><strong>to go it alone </strong></span>and be <span class="s1"><strong>self-employed </strong></span>… I’m not sure what area of business it would be but I think I’d enjoy the process of <span class="s1"><strong>drawing up a business plan </strong></span>and seeing if I could be successful …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is your town a nice place to live?</p>
<p class="p1">Monique: It’s OK … the main problem we have is our local high street … it used to be a busy centre but lots of shops have <span class="s1"><strong>gone bust </strong></span>… it must be very difficult <span class="s1"><strong>to make a profit </strong></span>when you have huge supermarkets in the area and a lot haven’t been able to survive with such <span class="s1"><strong>cut-throat competition</strong></span>…</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Part 2-style task </strong></span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a business you know that you admire. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">What this business is</li>
<li class="p3">What the business sells</li>
<li class="p2">How long you have known about the business</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you like it so much.</p>
<p class="p1">Magda: Actually I discovered a business very recently that I like so much I’d like to do something similar in the future … it’s a small <span class="s1"><strong>niche business </strong></span>that runs courses in how to cook … especially bread … the owner uses his kitchen for the courses and <span class="s1"><strong>went into business with </strong></span>a local community shop and sells a lot of the bread and cakes they make in the shop … I first got to hear about the business last year … my wife paid for me to do one of the baking courses and I got to know the owner during the training … it’s a <span class="s1"><strong>lifestyle business </strong></span>really … he doesn’t have plans <span class="s1"><strong>to take on employees </strong></span>or expand into new areas … he’s happy <span class="s1"><strong>earning a living </strong></span>doing the thing he loves … I really admire what he does and I’m sure a lot of people would love to do something similar … he <span class="s1"><strong>has a web presence </strong></span>… in fact that’s how we got to find out about his company … and he uses social media <span class="s1"><strong>to raise the company profile </strong></span>… but he’s the only person involved in <span class="s1"><strong>running the business </strong></span>so he’s in complete control of where the business goes … that’s something that must make it really satisfying … as long as he’s managing <span class="s1"><strong>to balance the books </strong></span>and the <span class="s1"><strong>cash flow </strong></span>is healthy I’m sure he must be very pleased with what he has achieved …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Why do some people decide to set up their own business?</p>
<p class="p1">Marion: I suppose it’s the idea of being in control of your own destiny … or of believing in a product or service idea you may have … plus it must be very exciting … <span class="s1"><strong>launching products </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>winning contracts </strong></span>… and seeing your <span class="s1"><strong>sales figures </strong></span>improving must be wonderful …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are some of the dangers involved in starting a business?</p>
<p class="p1">Hiro: Well … obviously you need to have a good idea … some people say you need to <strong>do </strong><span class="s1"><strong>market research </strong></span>beforehand so you know what the market wants … if you don’t do this you could <span class="s1"><strong>go under </strong></span>… and if it is a good idea the chances are someone else is doing the same thing so you could end up facing <span class="s1"><strong>stiff competition </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are some of things you have to do when running your own business that might not appeal to everyone?</p>
<p class="p1">Katy: Personally i don’t like being in debt so <span class="s1"><strong>taking out a business loan </strong></span>wouldn’t suit me at all … and I know a lot of companies do <span class="s1"><strong>cold calling </strong></span>to try and <span class="s1"><strong>drum up business </strong></span>… that’s something I’d hate to do … and <span class="s1"><strong>laying people off </strong></span>if the business gets into trouble … that would be horrible …</p>
