<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Are there any TV channels in your country that don’t have adverts?</p>
<p class="p2">Loraine: No … they’re all <span class="s1"><strong>commercial channels </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>show adverts </strong></span>all day long … too many really … and there’s also a lot of <span class="s1"><strong>product placement </strong></span>going on … especially in soap operas where they place an item just behind the actors.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you enjoy watching adverts on TV?</p>
<p class="p2">Karin: No … not really … I hate <span class="s1"><strong>commercial breaks </strong></span>during a film … it really spoils the flow … and during <span class="s1"><strong>prime time </strong></span>viewing they seem to squeeze even more ads in than usual … <span class="s1"><strong>celebrity endorsements </strong></span>also get on my nerves … everyone knows they’re only doing it because they’re getting paid.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are the best ways for ordinary people to advertise something they want to sell in your country?</p>
<p class="p1">Marianne: The simplest way is to <span class="s1"><strong>place an advert </strong></span>in something like the <span class="s1"><strong>classified ads </strong></span>section of a local paper … or there’s the Internet of course … there are lots of sites like eBay where you can <span class="s1"><strong>buy and sell </strong></span>things online.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe an advert you once saw that was very effective. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">Where this advert appeared</li>
<li class="p3">When you saw it</li>
<li class="p2">What it was advertising</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you thought it was so effective.</p>
<p class="p1">Max: OK … well this was about 4 years ago … I was looking for some software to create videos … one day I got an email from a <span class="s1"><strong>mailing list </strong></span>I’d signed up to … there was a link in it to a <span class="s1"><strong>press release </strong></span>… a company had written something about a new product that was similar to what I was looking for … at the end of the press release there was a link to the <span class="s1"><strong>sales page </strong></span>… I hadn’t heard of the company but I was interested and clicked the link to the ad …. what caught my attention immediately were the number of testimonials from people who had bought the software … I think testimonials are like the online equivalent of <span class="s1"><strong>word of mouth </strong></span>advertising and are really persuasive … anyway … when I got to the bottom of the page there was a great big <span class="s1"><strong>call to action </strong></span>button inviting me to buy … I was totally persuaded and ended up making a purchase … what made it so effective I think was the power of those testimonials … they’d been written by people very much like me … they’d had a need and the software had obviously turned out to be just what they were looking for … when you think that this was a newish company they wouldn’t have had any <span class="s1"><strong>brand awareness </strong></span>at all … they probably wouldn’t have had much of a budget for advertising … obviously you wouldn’t advertise a product like this through the <span class="s1"><strong>mass media </strong></span>on TV … they probably didn’t even have an <span class="s1"><strong>advertising agency </strong></span>to support them …and yet they’d managed to create a great deal of <span class="s1"><strong>brand loyalty </strong></span>from previous customers … I think that was really effective.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What is it that makes an advert effective?</p>
<p class="p1">Spencer: Well … when a company <span class="s1"><strong>launches a product </strong></span>they have to consider the Internet … especially how it can be used to spread the word on <span class="s1"><strong>social media </strong></span>… so in this context a video that <span class="s1"><strong>goes viral </strong></span>is probably the most effective type of advert you could make.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are the advantages to companies of advertising on the Internet rather than TV?</p>
<p class="p1">Stelios: I’d imagine the main advantage is you can reach your <span class="s1"><strong>target audience </strong></span>much more effectively … if you bring out a <span class="s1"><strong>niche product </strong></span>for example … or you have a tight <span class="s1"><strong>advertising budget </strong></span>… you can advertise on particular sites that the people you want to reach visit … that’s not something you can do on TV.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What things do advertising companies do that might give it a bad name?</p>
<p class="p1">Raol: For me the most irritating is <span class="s1"><strong>cold calling </strong></span>… we must get two or three of these every day at work … then there’s <span class="s1"><strong>junk mail </strong></span>that gets posted through the letterbox … and of course the online equivalent of this … <span class="s1"><strong>spam emails </strong></span>… I think it’s this kind of advertising that tends to annoy people.</p>
