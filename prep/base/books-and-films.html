<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you like to read books? Marie: Yes … I love reading … I like nothing more than <span class="s1"><strong>to be engrossed in </strong></span>a good book … I regularly <span class="s1"><strong>take out </strong></span>books from the library and usually read them <span class="s1"><strong>from cover to cover </strong></span>in no time … and I can’t go to sleep at night without some good <span class="s1"><strong>bedtime reading </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: How often do you go to the cinema? Jemma: Unfortunately we don’t have a cinema near us so we have to go into the nearest town <span class="s1"><strong>to catch the latest movie </strong></span>… I usually avoid seeing popular <span class="s1"><strong>box-office hits </strong></span>which I’m not always keen on seeing … I prefer <span class="s1"><strong>low-budget films </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>sci-fi </strong></span>especially … and there’s a great cinema I go to that has frequent <span class="s1"><strong>showings </strong></span>of films like these …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you prefer reading books or watching films? Louisa: I’m not really <span class="s1"><strong>a big reader </strong></span>… I find books quite <span class="s1"><strong>heavy-going </strong></span>… so I much prefer to see a film … perhaps it’s the <span class="s1"><strong>special effects </strong></span>or the <span class="s1"><strong>soundtrack </strong></span>… I don’t know … I just prefer a film …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a book you have read or a film you have seen. You should say:</p>

<li class="p3">When you read or saw it</li>
<li class="p2">Why you decided to see the film or read the book</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say if you enjoyed it and why.</p>
<p class="p1">Pauline I like reading … especially English novels … it’s a great way to improve your vocabulary and there are so many fantastic authors to choose from … one book that <span class="s1"><strong>came highly recommended </strong></span>by my teacher was The Mayor of Casterbridge … I was studying at a school in The UK at the time and she said it would give me a picture of what life was like years ago in the area I was living … well I have to say I absolutely loved it … it was <span class="s1"><strong>a real page-turner </strong></span>… it’s a <span class="s1"><strong>historical novel </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>the setting </strong></span>was a fictional town called Casterbridge … but actually it was <span class="s1"><strong>based on </strong></span>a town near where I was studying called Dorchester … it had such a great <span class="s1"><strong>plot </strong></span>… to cut a long story short <span class="s1"><strong>it tells the story of </strong></span>the downfall of a man called Henchard <span class="s1"><strong>the central character </strong></span>who lives during a period of great social change around the time of the industrial revolution … the reason I enjoyed it so much … apart from the great story … it gave me a picture of what life had been like in the place I was studying at the time … I really <span class="s1"><strong>couldn’t put it down </strong></span>… a fantastic story …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is reading as pleasurable in digital format? Alise: Personally I prefer reading a <span class="s1"><strong>paperback </strong></span>or <strong>hardback </strong>… especially if I’m reading <span class="s1"><strong>a classic </strong></span>which I don’t think feels right as an <span class="s1"><strong>e-book </strong></span>… but I can see it can be good for others … my grandmother has an <span class="s1"><strong>e-reader </strong></span>and she loves the way you can enlarge the text …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you think bookshops will survive the digital revolution? Thomas: I think so … at least I hope so … I love <span class="s1"><strong>flicking through </strong></span>books in a bookshop … online shopping is useful … finding out on Amazon if a book you want has <span class="s1"><strong>got a good review </strong></span>… maybe getting one that is difficult to find … but I still love the experience of being in a bookshop …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Statistics show that visits to the cinema are up despite the availability of DVDs and online downloads. Why do you think this might be? Jamie: I think it’s the whole experience that the cinema offers … going out <span class="s1"><strong>to see a film </strong></span>when it <span class="s1"><strong>goes on general release </strong></span>… and seeing it <span class="s1"><strong>on the big screen </strong></span>is more exciting than <span class="s1"><strong>watching the film</strong></span>at home on TV … especially if it’s <span class="s1"><strong>an action movie </strong></span>… and watching it with others makes it even more special …</p>
