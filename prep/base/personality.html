Read the following IELTS-style questions and answers below and pay attention to the phrases in <span class="s1"><strong>bold</strong></span>. Use the ‘Definitions’ section at the bottom of the page to check the meaning of any phrases you don’t understand.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: How would you describe yourself?</p>
<p class="p2">Paula: Everyone tells me I <span class="s1"><strong>take after </strong></span>my mum as I’m quite <span class="s1"><strong>laid-back </strong></span>… I think I’m <span class="s1"><strong>good company</strong></span>but you should ask my friends if they agree …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: In which ways are you similar to your friends?</p>
<p class="p2">Manuel: I seem to be attracted to <span class="s1"><strong>introverts </strong></span>… not people who are <span class="s1"><strong>painfully shy </strong></span>but most of my friends are a little <span class="s1"><strong>reserved </strong></span>… and I think that’s what I’m like…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Are you similar or different to your brother(s)/sister(s)?</p>
<p class="p1">Mira: I think my brother and I are very similar … I’d say we’re <span class="s1"><strong>fun-loving </strong></span>and tend to be a bit <span class="s1"><strong>extroverted </strong></span>… my brother is certainly <span class="s1"><strong>the life and soul of the party </strong></span>… I’m not sure that applies to me …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a teacher you once had who you enjoyed being taught by. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">Who this person was</li>
<li class="p3">When they were your teacher</li>
<li class="p2">Which subject they taught you</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and describe what it was about their character that you liked.</p>
<p class="p1">Carolina: I’d like to describe my English teacher from school … Miss Thomas … this was a few years ago now and she was my teacher at a time when I was getting a little bored with being at school … unlike some of the other teachers Miss Thomas never <span class="s1"><strong>lost her temper </strong></span>… she was very calm and <span class="s1"><strong>easy-going </strong></span>… she was also very <span class="s1"><strong>broad-minded </strong></span>… we were able to ask her questions about lots of subjects that some other teachers would refuse to discuss which made us respect her even more … she had a great <span class="s1"><strong>sense of humour </strong></span>too … she’d laugh at our jokes as well as making us laugh … and she would also <span class="s1"><strong>bend over backwards </strong></span>to help us with our work … she always <span class="s1"><strong>put us first </strong></span>and often stayed around at the end of class to talk with anyone who needed help … apparently she was highly respected within her field but you would never know as she was the type that <span class="s1"><strong>hid her light under a bushel </strong></span>… she was very modest and <span class="s1"><strong>self-effacing </strong></span>… so yes … Miss Thomas was a teacher I have fond memories of …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Which personal qualities do you think we most want to pass on to our children?</p>
<p class="p1">Martin: I certainly would want my children to be <span class="s1"><strong>self-confident </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>self-assured </strong></span>… I really believe that people who feel good about themselves are in a good position to face what life has to offer them … and I’d hope they wouldn’t be <span class="s1"><strong>self-centred </strong></span>… but remembered to think about others …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Which characteristics do you think are the least appealing in a person?</p>
<p class="p1">Marianne: Well … people who are very <span class="s1"><strong>narrow-minded </strong></span>are difficult to get on with … it’s nice when someone is open to other people’s opinion and willing to think about their own views … and people who are <span class="s1"><strong>two-faced </strong></span>can be a little irritating … relationships are built on trust and without honesty there’s not much left …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Which personality types do you think are less likely to suffer from stress or anxiety?</p>
<p class="p1">Sol: Probably people who are <span class="s1"><strong>thick-skinned </strong></span>… who don’t let people or problems affect them too much … and if you are <span class="s1"><strong>fair-minded </strong></span>you’ ll be less likely to overreact to situations or be <span class="s1"><strong>quick-tempered </strong></span>…</p>
