<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you often go shopping for personal items?</p>
<p class="p2">Maxine: When I can afford it yes … my college is in the city centre and I do a lot of <span class="s1"><strong>window shopping </strong></span>… but being a student I’m <span class="s1"><strong>on a tight budget </strong></span>so I have <span class="s1"><strong>to be careful with money </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Are there many shops where you live?</p>
<p class="p2">Jenny: We’ve got a few <span class="s1"><strong>local shops </strong></span>nearby and a few <span class="s1"><strong>independent stores </strong></span>but none of the big <span class="s1"><strong>high street names </strong></span>… I have to go into town for them …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you enjoy shopping?</p>
<p class="p2">Marco: It depends … I hate it when the sales are on … crowds of people all trying to <span class="s1"><strong>snap up a bargain </strong></span>… I find it all a bit stressful … I also get annoyed when <span class="s1"><strong>shop assistants </strong></span>try to <span class="s1"><strong>give me the hard sell </strong></span>when all I want to do is look around …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a time when you bought something for someone. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">When this was</li>
<li class="p3">What is was you bought</li>
<li class="p2">Who you bought it for</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say how you felt about buying it for them.</p>
<p class="p1">Coleen: I’d like to tell you about the time … about four years ago … my husband and I bought a computer for our daughter … she was about to go to university and we’d promised her we would treat her to one … at the time there had been a big <span class="s1"><strong>advertising campaign </strong></span>for the latest Apple Macbook and our daughter was very keen to have one … she kept telling us they were <span class="s1"><strong>value for money </strong></span>… even though they seemed very expensive to us … anyway we tried <span class="s1"><strong>to shop around </strong></span>to see if we could <span class="s1"><strong>pick up a bargain </strong></span>… this was in the middle of the <span class="s1"><strong>summer sales </strong></span>and wherever you went <span class="s1"><strong>prices were being slashed </strong></span>on <span class="s1"><strong>big brand names </strong></span>… but unfortunately not Apple products … we ended up having <span class="s1"><strong>to pay the full price </strong></span>… I remember my daughter justifying the cost by pointing out how nice the Apple <span class="s1"><strong>carrier bag </strong></span>was … but it was lovely to see her so excited and the <span class="s1"><strong>customer service </strong></span>she’s received during the four years she’s had it has been excellent … so it was value for money after all …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you think we will stop using paper money in the future?</p>
<p class="p1">Louisa: I think it’s almost certain … at the moment it’s still possible <span class="s1"><strong>to pay in cash </strong></span>but I’m sure this will change … the problem is people are more likely <span class="s1"><strong>to get into debt </strong></span>and <span class="s1"><strong>run up a credit card bill</strong></span>when this happens.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: How do companies encourage the consumer to spend their money?</p>
<p class="p1">Peter: Well … a recent development in my country is something called ‘Black Friday’ where people are encouraged <span class="s1"><strong>to shop until they drop </strong></span>and buy the latest <span class="s1"><strong>must-have products </strong></span>… then there are things like <span class="s1"><strong>loyalty cards </strong></span>to get the customer back in the store …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What do you think shops need to do to create a positive shopping experience?</p>
<p class="p1">Tania: The main thing for me is not being pressurised to buy … I appreciate that shop assistants are probably <span class="s1"><strong>on commission </strong></span>but if I’m looking for clothes for example I like to take my time … <span class="s1"><strong>to try something on </strong></span>… and to ask for help if I need it …</p>
