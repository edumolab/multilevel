<h2 id="example-of-speaking-part-1-questions">Example of speaking part 1 questions</h2>
<h4 id="what-type-of-technology-do-you-use-in-your-home-">What type of technology do you use in your home?</h4>
<p>Answer: We have a number of labour-saving devices including state of the art technology in our kitchen. These appliances include an induction stove, a dishwasher, and an Internet-enabled refrigerator. All are connected through the Internet of Things so we can remotely control them.</p>
<h4 id="are-you-comfortable-using-modern-technology-">Are you comfortable using modern technology?</h4>
<p>Answer: You don\&#39;t have to be a rocket scientist to use technology today. It\&#39;s all about booting up, logging in and then clicking on the icon that will take you to your favourite application. On the single occasion that my computer crashed, I called someone in to re-install the programs otherwise I\&#39;m comfortable.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-keep-your-computer-and-data-secure-">How do you keep your computer and data secure?</h4>
<p>Answer: I always shut down the computer at night. I backup my files to a hard drive and I always keep hard copies of important documents. I am very careful with my privacy settings, especially in wireless hotspots.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-part-2-questions">Speaking part 2 questions</h2>
<h4 id="describe-an-item-of-modern-technology-that-is-most-important-to-you-">Describe an item of modern technology that is most important to you?</h4>
<p>In this type of question, you should describe the type of technology that you use, how long you have been using it, how frequently you use it and how it is a necessary part of your life.</p>
<p>Answer: My laptop is the most important digital appliance in my home. I have had a laptop for years, but I have recently upgraded my computer.</p>
<p>I am computer literate. I study from home and I need Internet access to do my research. Advances in technology have also made it possible for me to work from home. I surf the web in search of freelance opportunities.</p>
<p>In my leisure time, I download books and music from the Internet. I pay for these via Electronic Funds Transfer. I do not condone online piracy, as I value the arts and believe that the authors and songwriters should be rewarded for their work.</p>
<p>I use social media networks to keep up with my friends and family across the globe and I also shop online from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-questions">Part 3 questions</h2>
<h4 id="do-you-think-that-there-are-any-disadvantages-to-modern-technology-">Do you think that there are any disadvantages to modern technology?</h4>
<p>Answer: I think that there are several disadvantages. Security can be a problem with people hacking into the Internet. Also, modern technology tends to become rapidly obsolete so we become more and more a throw-away society. People are also losing physical contact with one another as they become glued to their screens.</p>
<p>In what ways do you think people will benefit from technologies in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: Emerging technology has the capacity to change our lives in so many ways. Robots and artificial intelligence are both reducing the amount of tedious work required in a wide range of industries and professions. We can now also get expert advice from across the globe using an internet connection.</p>
<p>In your opinion what are the basic computer skills that every person should have today?</p>
<p>Answer: All the information we require is available on the Internet, so everyone should be able to boot up a computer, log in and know how to use a search engine. Everyone should have access to the Internet so that they can surf the web.</p>
