<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2">Examiner: What kind of holiday do you like? Miguel: I try to avoid <strong><span class="s1">tourist traps </span></strong>… I like <strong><span class="s1">to get away from it all </span></strong>and prefer going somewhere <strong><span class="s1">off the beaten track </span></strong>… last year I had <strong><span class="s1">the holiday of a lifetime </span></strong>… a two week <strong><span class="s1">wildlife safari </span></strong>in Kenya.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What do you like to do when you’re on holiday? Anna: I enjoy visiting the local <strong><span class="s1">places of interest </span></strong>… I like <strong><span class="s1">to go sightseeing </span></strong>and always sign up for <strong><span class="s1">guided tours </span></strong>as it’s a chance to be shown around and take photographs … one of my my hobbies.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you have many tourists in your country? Amy: Yes … we have a lot of <strong><span class="s1">holiday resorts </span></strong>along the coast that are popular with tourists … most people come on <strong><span class="s1">package holidays </span></strong>and stay in one of the many hotels and <strong><span class="s1">self-catering </span></strong>apartments.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>Part 2-style task </b></span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a beautiful place you once visited. You should say:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>When you went to this place</li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>Where it was</li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>Who you went with</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you liked it so much.</p>
<p class="p1">Sally: A few years ago I went on a <strong><span class="s1">long weekend </span></strong>to the Lake District in the UK … it’s a very popular <strong><span class="s1">holiday destination </span></strong>in the north of England … I went on my own and had a wonderful time … I stayed in a <strong><span class="s1">youth hostel </span></strong>and met some really nice people … but the most memorable thing about the holiday were the <span class="s1"><b>breathtaking views </b></span>… and lovely <span class="s1"><b>picturesque villages </b></span>… it can get very busy with <strong><span class="s1">hordes of tourists </span></strong>so I decided <strong><span class="s1">to go out of season </span></strong>in the autumn … the weather was fantastic and the shops were full of <strong><span class="s1">local crafts </span></strong>… a really great holiday … it’s certainly not the kind of <strong><span class="s1">short break </span></strong>for someone looking for a busy nightlife but if you want to relax in the middle of <strong><span class="s1">stunning landscape </span></strong>I would certainly recommend a holiday to the Lake District.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>Part 3-style questions </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1">Examiner: What do you think has led to the growth in the tourism industry? Miguel: It’s much easier and affordable to travel now … nowadays you can get cheap <strong><span class="s1">charter-flights </span></strong>or <strong><span class="s1">all-in packages </span></strong>… to somewhere near or to <strong><span class="s1">a far-off destination</span></strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: How do people tend to choose a destination? Anna: The Internet is a great source of information and high street <span class="s1"><b>travel agents </b></span>are still very popular … that’s where I like to go to get <strong><span class="s1">holiday brochures </span></strong>for the place I’m interested in.</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: People sometimes say flying is the most glamorous form of travel. Do you agree? Amy: I’m not so sure really … flying can be quite boring … queuing up at the <strong><span class="s1">check-in desk </span></strong>… going through <strong><span class="s1">passport control </span></strong>… sitting for ages in the <strong><span class="s1">departure lounge </span></strong>… then the flight itself can be quite uncomfortable … no … I’m not sure I agree.</p>
