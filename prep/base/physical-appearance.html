<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Part 3-style</strong> questions</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is it important to dress well whenever we go out?</p>
<p class="p1">Mark: It depends where you’re going … I know some people <span class="s1"><strong>get done up </strong></span>just to go to the shops … but I don’t see the point … you shouldn’t go out looking <span class="s1"><strong>scruffy </strong></span>with <span class="s1"><strong>disheveled hair </strong></span>but I really don’t see the point in <span class="s1"><strong>getting dressed up to the nines </strong></span>unless you’re going somewhere special …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do people worry too much about their appearance as they get older?</p>
<p class="p1">Mira: I’m sure they do … yes … but it happens to all of us doesn’t it … we all <span class="s1"><strong>go grey </strong></span>eventually and get <span class="s1"><strong>hard of hearing </strong></span>… we start <span class="s1"><strong>to lose our figure </strong></span>… that’s why plastic surgery is so popular … personally I think we just need <span class="s1"><strong>to grow old gracefully </strong></span>and not worry too much about how we look …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is attractiveness a quality worthwhile aiming for?</p>
<p class="p1">Phoebe: I’d like to say no … it shouldn’t matter what we look like in terms of our physical appearance … but unfortunately it seems women especially are taken more seriously if they are <span class="s1"><strong>good looking </strong></span>with <span class="s1"><strong>a slender figure </strong></span>with perfect <span class="s1"><strong>make up </strong></span>and so on …</p>
