<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you look like any other people in your family?</p>
<p class="p2">Carlo: No … not at all … take my brother for example … he has short <span class="s1"><strong>cropped hair </strong></span>and has quite a <span class="s1"><strong>pointed face </strong></span>… he’s also quite <span class="s1"><strong>fair-skinned </strong></span>compared to me…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Tell me about your family.</p>
<p class="p1">Andrea: My father’<span class="s1"><strong>s getting on a bit </strong></span>… he’s <span class="s1"><strong>in his 60s </strong></span>… but he <span class="s1"><strong>looks very young for his age </strong></span>… he still does lots of exercise and is quite <span class="s1"><strong>well-built </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What does your best friend look like?</p>
<p class="p1">Mandy: She’s the same age as me … she has <span class="s1"><strong>shoulder-length hair </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>fair hair </strong></span>… she has a <span class="s1"><strong>slim figure </strong></span>and is <span class="s1"><strong>medium height </strong></span>…</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Part</strong> 2-style<strong> task </strong></span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a person whose appearance you like. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">Who this person is</li>
<li class="p3">What their relationship is to you</li>
<li class="p2">What they look like</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say what it is about their appearance you like.</p>
<p class="p1">Monique: OK … I’d like to talk about my aunt … her name’s Marta and she’s quite a character … she’<span class="s1"><strong>s middle-aged </strong></span>but has a very <span class="s1"><strong>youthful appearance </strong></span>… she’s a little <span class="s1"><strong>overweight </strong></span>I suppose but not too much … she has a friendly <span class="s1"><strong>round face </strong></span>framed by <span class="s1"><strong>thick blonde hair </strong></span>… she has a lovely <span class="s1"><strong>complexion </strong></span>and she’s always <span class="s1"><strong>well-turned out </strong></span>… she actually always looks like she’s going out for the evening to somewhere special … there’<span class="s1"><strong>s never a hair out of place </strong></span>… I’ve always thought she <span class="s1"><strong>bears a striking resemblance to </strong></span>someone on TV … I can’t remember the name now … she <span class="s1"><strong>wears glasses </strong></span>and always seems to have a different pair on every time I see her … I like the way she looks because she wears clothes that are right for her age and manages to look glamorous without it looking like she’s too done up … yes … I’ll be happy if I look like her when I’m her age …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Part 3-style</strong> questions</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is it important to dress well whenever we go out?</p>
<p class="p1">Mark: It depends where you’re going … I know some people <span class="s1"><strong>get done up </strong></span>just to go to the shops … but I don’t see the point … you shouldn’t go out looking <span class="s1"><strong>scruffy </strong></span>with <span class="s1"><strong>disheveled hair </strong></span>but I really don’t see the point in <span class="s1"><strong>getting dressed up to the nines </strong></span>unless you’re going somewhere special …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do people worry too much about their appearance as they get older?</p>
<p class="p1">Mira: I’m sure they do … yes … but it happens to all of us doesn’t it … we all <span class="s1"><strong>go grey </strong></span>eventually and get <span class="s1"><strong>hard of hearing </strong></span>… we start <span class="s1"><strong>to lose our figure </strong></span>… that’s why plastic surgery is so popular … personally I think we just need <span class="s1"><strong>to grow old gracefully </strong></span>and not worry too much about how we look …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is attractiveness a quality worthwhile aiming for?</p>
<p class="p1">Phoebe: I’d like to say no … it shouldn’t matter what we look like in terms of our physical appearance … but unfortunately it seems women especially are taken more seriously if they are <span class="s1"><strong>good looking </strong></span>with <span class="s1"><strong>a slender figure </strong></span>with perfect <span class="s1"><strong>make up </strong></span>and so on …</p>
