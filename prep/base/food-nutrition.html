<h2 id="examples-of-ielts-speaking-part-1-questions">Examples of IELTS speaking part 1 questions</h2>
<h4 id="examiner-what-food-do-you-like-to-eat-">Examiner: What food do you like to eat?</h4>
<p>Answer: I am not a fussy eater. As long as you don\&#39;t feed me rabbit food I\&#39;m easy to please. My flatmate and I share the cooking chores. Once a week we make a slap-up meal of steak and chips covered in a rich sauce and to satisfy the sweet tooth we finish off with a decadent chocolate pudding.</p>
<h4 id="examiner-so-do-you-enjoy-cooking-">Examiner: So, do you enjoy cooking?</h4>
<p>Answer: I prefer eating to cooking. I make good use of ready meals and I am not averse to junk food or the occasional pub lunch. I realize though that it is necessary to include nutritious food in my diet, which is why I cook several times a week.</p>
<h4 id="examiner-what-is-your-favourite-meal-of-the-day-">Examiner: What is your favourite meal of the day?</h4>
<p>Answer: I\&#39;m a breakfast fan. I wake up starving hungry after a good night\&#39;s sleep. I like nothing better than a good English breakfast of bacon, eggs, and buttery toast, along with a piping hot cup of coffee.</p>
<h2 id="ielts-speaking-part-2-question">IELTS speaking part 2 question</h2>
<h4 id="examiner-tell-me-about-your-favourite-restaurant">Examiner: Tell me about your favourite restaurant</h4>
<p>In this question, you should discuss</p>
<p>the restaurant that you like best,
why you like it,
and the occasions when you go there.
Answer: I enjoy fine dining and exotic food. Both are available at my favourite restaurant in the centre of town. On special occasions I take my partner wining and dining. We love the ambience of the candle-lit dinners, and the extensive menu of mouth-watering meals.</p>
<p>The menu includes starters, mains and deserts. Usually by the time we get there I am dying of hunger so we order a starter to calm the hunger pangs. We usually also share a bottle of bubbly. It is after all a celebration. Having finished our starter we take our time, savouring the food.</p>
<p>This is not the type of restaurant where you would ask for a doggy bag, so we waste nothing. We end the evening with a delicious dessert. After settling the bill, we head off home, satisfied that we have enjoyed a scrumptious meal.</p>
<h2 id="ielts-speaking-part-3-questions">IELTS speaking part 3 questions</h2>
<h4 id="examiner-do-you-believe-that-the-21st-century-diet-is-a-healthy-one-">Examiner: Do you believe that the 21st Century diet is a healthy one?</h4>
<p>Answer: Far too many people are overweight. I believe that people should cut down on sugars and refined carbohydrates and replace them with leafy vegetables and seasonal fruits. A balanced diet would help them to regulate their weight.</p>
<h4 id="examiner-starvation-is-a-problem-in-many-parts-of-the-world-what-do-you-think-should-be-done-about-it-">Examiner: Starvation is a problem in many parts of the world. What do you think should be done about it?</h4>
<p>Answer: From what I\&#39;ve read current global food production can cover the daily consumption needs of the world. We need to find a way to economically transport it to where it is most needed or find alternate food sources. Nobody should starve when there is no shortage of food.</p>
<h4 id="examiner-in-homes-where-both-parents-work-do-you-think-cooking-has-become-just-another-job-at-the-end-of-the-day-">Examiner: In homes where both parents work do you think cooking has become just another job at the end of the day?</h4>
<p>Answer: I know that food preparation can be time-consuming, but if everyone helps with ideas and recipes and everyone takes a turn and lends a hand, cooking can be fun for the family. Home cooked meals are also often healthier and packed with vitamins.</p>
