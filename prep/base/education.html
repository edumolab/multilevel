Michel: Yes … I’m taking <span class="s1"><strong>an intensive course </strong></span>at a local <span class="s1"><strong>private language school </strong></span>… I <span class="s1"><strong>attend classes</strong></span>three times a week …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Would you say you are a good student? Susan: I’m OK I think … I’m pretty good at <span class="s1"><strong>meeting deadlines </strong></span>and I’m <span class="s1"><strong>keeping up with my studies</strong></span>… plus I find it quite easy to <span class="s1"><strong>learn things by heart </strong></span>which is useful when learning a language …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: When you were younger did you enjoy your time at school?</p>
<p class="p1">Theo: Yes … I liked school … it was an ordinary <span class="s1"><strong>state school </strong></span>… nothing special … <span class="s1"><strong>a single-sex school </strong></span>… which I’m not sure I liked … but the teachers were great … I had lots of friends and I never <span class="s1"><strong>played truant </strong></span>like some pupils there …</p>

<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Examiner: What qualities do you think a good teacher has? Anna: They should be patient … they should be <span class="s1"><strong>subject specialists </strong></span>and be able to explain the subject clearly … they should <span class="s1"><strong>give feedback </strong></span>quickly … for example not hang on to essay for ages like some of my teachers …</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: What are the advantages of studying on a distance learning course? Florrie: It’s a more flexible way of studying especially if you have a job … <span class="s1"><strong>tuition fees </strong></span>are usually cheaper … but you have to be very motivated … and I would <span class="s1">imagine more people </span><strong>fall behind with their studies </strong><span class="s1">compared to </span><strong>face-to-face classes </strong><span class="s1">… </span></p>
<p class="p2">Examiner: Do all children get equal opportunities in education? Julie: In my country I think it is quite equal but in the UK I’ve heard that most people who go to the top universities have studied at <span class="s2"><strong>public schools </strong></span>… you have to be very rich to study in a school like that … they’re usually <span class="s2"><strong>boarding schools </strong></span>as well so the fees are enormous …</p>
