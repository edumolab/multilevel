<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Are you studying English at a school? Michel: Yes … I’m taking <span class="s1"><strong>an intensive course </strong></span>at a local <span class="s1"><strong>private language school </strong></span>… I <span class="s1"><strong>attend classes</strong></span>three times a week …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Would you say you are a good student? Susan: I’m OK I think … I’m pretty good at <span class="s1"><strong>meeting deadlines </strong></span>and I’m <span class="s1"><strong>keeping up with my studies</strong></span>… plus I find it quite easy to <span class="s1"><strong>learn things by heart </strong></span>which is useful when learning a language …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: When you were younger did you enjoy your time at school?</p>
<p class="p1">Theo: Yes … I liked school … it was an ordinary <span class="s1"><strong>state school </strong></span>… nothing special … <span class="s1"><strong>a single-sex school </strong></span>… which I’m not sure I liked … but the teachers were great … I had lots of friends and I never <span class="s1"><strong>played truant </strong></span>like some pupils there …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a time during your education that you really enjoyed. You should say:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">When this period was</li>
<li class="p3">Where you were</li>
<li class="p2">What you were studying at the time</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you were so happy.</p>
<p class="p1">Caroline: I’d like to tell you about my time at university … I was <span class="s1"><strong>a mature student </strong></span>… I didn’t go to university until I was 25 … and it was my first time away from my parents so it was very exciting … I was doing <span class="s1"><strong>a Bachelors Degree </strong></span>and it was a bit of a challenge … some people <span class="s1"><strong>take a year out </strong></span>but I’d been away from education for 8 years … plus I had <span class="s1"><strong>to work my way through uni </strong></span>so I was very busy … and <span class="s1"><strong>sitting exams </strong></span>at the end of each year was a new experience for me as well but I really enjoyed <span class="s1"><strong>higher education </strong></span>learning about a subject I loved … history … and the social life was great as well … I don’t think I’ve ever had so many friends … I had my <span class="s1"><strong>graduation ceremony </strong></span>last year in the local cathedral and I know my parents were really proud … so yes … that was a really happy time … I’m thinking of doing a <span class="s1"><strong>Masters Degree </strong></span>soon … though that might be through <span class="s1"><strong>distance learning </strong></span>as I have a full-time job now …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Examiner: What qualities do you think a good teacher has? Anna: They should be patient … they should be <span class="s1"><strong>subject specialists </strong></span>and be able to explain the subject clearly … they should <span class="s1"><strong>give feedback </strong></span>quickly … for example not hang on to essay for ages like some of my teachers …</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: What are the advantages of studying on a distance learning course? Florrie: It’s a more flexible way of studying especially if you have a job … <span class="s1"><strong>tuition fees </strong></span>are usually cheaper … but you have to be very motivated … and I would <span class="s1">imagine more people </span><strong>fall behind with their studies </strong><span class="s1">compared to </span><strong>face-to-face classes </strong><span class="s1">… </span></p>
<p class="p2">Examiner: Do all children get equal opportunities in education? Julie: In my country I think it is quite equal but in the UK I’ve heard that most people who go to the top universities have studied at <span class="s2"><strong>public schools </strong></span>… you have to be very rich to study in a school like that … they’re usually <span class="s2"><strong>boarding schools </strong></span>as well so the fees are enormous …</p>
