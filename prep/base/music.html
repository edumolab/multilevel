<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What kind of music do you listen to?</p>
<p class="p2">Katherine: I’m a big fan of <span class="s1"><strong>classical music </strong></span>… it doesn’t make me very popular with my children … their <span class="s1"><strong>taste in music </strong></span>is completely different … they always want to listen to their favourite <span class="s1"><strong>rock bands </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you play any instruments?</p>
<p class="p2">Jamie: No I don’t … I’ve always wished I’d <span class="s1"><strong>taken up a musical instrument </strong></span>… I’d love to be able to play the guitar … but I think I’m a bit <span class="s1"><strong>tone deaf </strong></span>so perhaps I’d find it hard …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Have you got any hobbies or interests?</p>
<p class="p1">Marco: I’m really into <span class="s1"><strong>live music </strong></span>… I go to a lot of <span class="s1"><strong>music festivals </strong></span>… I think a <span class="s1"><strong>live performance</strong></span>always sounds more exciting than a recorded version … as long as the performers can sing and play well of course …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe a song you like to listen to. You should say</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">What the piece of music is called</li>
<li class="p3">How long you have liked it</li>
<li class="p2">When you like to listen to it</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you like it so much.</p>
<p class="p1">Millie: Well … I’m a little older than most students and when I was young Abba the Swedish <span class="s1"><strong>pop group </strong></span>were very famous … I don’t think it was cool to like them even though they had a <span class="s1"><strong>huge following </strong></span>but I think now people have realised what wonderful songs they wrote … one <span class="s1"><strong>piece of music </strong></span>in particular is called ‘Slipping through my fingers’ … it wasn’t a <span class="s1"><strong>massive hit </strong></span>but I love it … it’s a song for parents and it’s all about how quickly our children grow up … it’s a <span class="s1"><strong>slow number </strong></span>and like a lot of their songs it’s a very <span class="s1"><strong>catchy tune </strong></span>… the two women in Abba had great voices and it’s the kind of music you can also <span class="s1"><strong>sing along to </strong></span>easily … even if you don’t have a great voice … I listen to Abba when I feel like a <span class="s1"><strong>sing-song </strong></span>… and I especially like to listen when I’m doing the housework … it stops me thinking about the hard work …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Is the Internet a good or bad thing for the music industry? Thomas: On the one hand it’s good for marketing new <span class="s1"><strong>musical talent </strong></span>or particular bands but it’s so easy to share and <span class="s1"><strong>download tracks </strong></span>for free I think it is costing the industry a lot of money …</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Should music be treated as seriously as subjects like maths or sciences at school? Carla: I think it should … I don’t think it should be taught in a boring way … I mean making children <span class="s1"><strong>read music </strong></span>… but I do think they should be encouraged to play instruments and to <span class="s1"><strong>play things by ear </strong></span>perhaps … to keep the lessons fun …</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Where do people usually enjoy listening to music? Sally: In lots of ways or places … as <span class="s1"><strong>background music </strong></span>when they are doing something else … at concerts when a band <span class="s1"><strong>goes on tour </strong></span>… or in clubs or discos …</p>
