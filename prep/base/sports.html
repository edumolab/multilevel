<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you do any sports? Loiuse: Not really … no … I always say I’m going <span class="s1"><strong>to take up exercise </strong></span>and try <span class="s1"><strong>to get into shape </strong></span>but I never seem to get started … I sometimes wonder whether I should get <span class="s1"><strong>a personal trainer </strong></span>… someone who will sort out <span class="s1"><strong>a fitness programme </strong></span>for me and make me <span class="s1"><strong>train hard </strong></span>….</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: How do you spend a typical weekend? Stella: I’m a big <span class="s1"><strong>football fan </strong></span>and weekends always centre around <span class="s1"><strong>a football match </strong></span>… I support FC Utrecht and have <span class="s1"><strong>a season ticket </strong></span>so I go to most of the <span class="s1"><strong>home games </strong></span>and quite a few of the <span class="s1"><strong>away games </strong></span>too … I’m really looking forward to the new <span class="s1"><strong>football season </strong></span>starting soon …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Have you got any hobbies or interests?</p>
<p class="p1">Theo: Yes … I’m really keen on sports … I <span class="s1"><strong>do judo </strong></span>once a week and <span class="s1"><strong>play tennis </strong></span>in the summer … I think it’s really important <span class="s1"><strong>to keep fit </strong></span>… it makes you feel good and energised for work and your studies ….</p>

<p class="p1">Maurice: I’d like to talk about my local <span class="s1"><strong>sports centre </strong></span>… it’s a place I spend a lot of time in … it’s a new building with all the latest <span class="s1"><strong>sports facilities </strong></span>… I probably go there at least twice a week … sometimes more often … it’s a huge place … there’s an outdoor <span class="s1"><strong>athletics track </strong></span>and some <span class="s1"><strong>football pitches </strong></span>… I <span class="s1"><strong>play football </strong></span>so I’m often out there … there are several indoor <span class="s1"><strong>squash and tennis courts </strong></span>that I use occasionally … a big <span class="s1"><strong>swimming pool </strong></span>… although I don’t use that very often … I’m not a very <span class="s1"><strong>strong swimmer </strong></span>… there’s a gym … lots of things really … why do I enjoy going there … it’s just a really fun place to be … there’s a good social side to it all … you can enter competitions … meet up with other people who want to do the same sports … and because there are so many activities on offer it gets you interested in different things … for example I was listening to some people talking about training <span class="s1"><strong>to run the marathon </strong></span>and I’ve decided I might even think about that … I <span class="s1"><strong>go jogging </strong></span>a couple of times a week so it would give me something to aim for … so yes … the sports centre … that’s the place I really like to visit …\</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Examiner: Should people be encouraged more to take up sport? Alejandro: I think young people should be given the chance to discover which sport they might like … watching sport is sometimes a good way to get people started … not on TV but actually getting out … take athletics for example … they could go to <span class="s1"><strong>an athletics meeting </strong></span>… there are so many different sports on show one might interest them …</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Why do some people enjoy participating in sport more than others? Florrie: That’s a good question … I suppose some people are more concerned about their health … they can’t stand the thought of <span class="s1"><strong>being out of condition </strong></span>… other people might be driven to excel … they want <span class="s1"><strong>to set records </strong></span>or get <span class="s1"><strong>personal bests </strong></span>…</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Which sports do you think are best for people who aren’t used to physical activity? Julie: Well … I think people like this should avoid <span class="s1"><strong>strenuous exercise </strong></span>so things like <strong>circuit training </strong>are definitely out of the question … maybe just doing <span class="s1"><strong>a brisk walk </strong></span>every day … or swimming is always a good way to get started …</p>
