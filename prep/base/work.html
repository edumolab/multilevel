<p class="p1">Read the following IELTS-style questions and answers below and pay attention to the phrases in <span class="s1"><strong>bold</strong></span>. Use the ‘Definitions’ section at the bottom of the page to check the meaning of any phrases you don’t understand.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1-style questions</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What do you do? Sasha: I <span class="s1"><strong>do a job-share </strong></span>with a friend in a boutique … I enjoy it … I like working with customers … unfortunately it’s only <span class="s1"><strong>temporary work </strong></span>but <span class="s1"><strong>one of the perks of the job </strong></span>is I get a discount on the clothes …</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you have any career plans yet? Carly: Yes … I’d like to <span class="s1"><strong>be my own boss </strong></span>one day … I’m interested in programming and I’d like to create apps for myself or for other companies … I know being <span class="s1"><strong>self employed </strong></span>would be a challenge but the idea of doing a <span class="s1"><strong>nine-to-five job </strong></span>doesn’t appeal to me at all …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What do you see yourself doing in 10 years time? Marie: I’d hope to be working … not <span class="s1"><strong>a high-powered job </strong></span>… but I’m quite a creative person so something where I can <span class="s1"><strong>work with my hands </strong></span>would be nice … as long as I’m not <span class="s1"><strong>stuck behind a desk </strong></span>doing something boring <span class="s1"><strong>in a dead-end job </strong></span>I’ll be happy …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task </span></h3>
<p class="p2">Describe your ideal job. You should say:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">What this job is</li>
<li class="p3">Whether you would need any qualifications</li>
<li class="p2">Whether it would be easy to find work</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">and say why you would enjoy this job in particular.</p>
<p class="p1">Max: I’ve always loved watching wildlife programmes on TV and often thought how much I’d enjoy working with animals … perhaps in a safari park … something like that … you’d probably need a degree to have any chance of being <span class="s1"><strong>called for an interview </strong></span>and whether there are many <span class="s1"><strong>full-time jobs </strong></span>I don’t know … I’m sure a lot of parks rely on <span class="s1"><strong>voluntary work </strong></span>so it might not be easy … and it probably wouldn’t be <span class="s1"><strong>well-paid </strong></span>either but money isn’t everything … I’d get so much<strong>job satisfaction </strong>… I can’t imagine it being the kind of job where you get <span class="s1"><strong>stuck in a rut </strong></span>… and I think I’d be good at it as well … I’d love to work with animals I enjoy <span class="s1"><strong>manual work </strong></span>and I’m <span class="s1"><strong>a good team player </strong></span>… so even though the <span class="s1"><strong>working conditions </strong></span>might not be the best I think that would be my ideal job …</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 3-style questions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: If there are a limited number of jobs available who should be given priority, young people or older people with more experience? Anna: Things are so different these days … a few years ago older employees would often <span class="s1"><strong>take early retirement </strong></span>or go onto <span class="s1"><strong>part-time </strong>contracts </span>and there were always opportunities for younger people but now jobs are so scarce … I think younger people need to be given the chance whenever possible …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are some of the important things a candidate should find out before accepting a job? Ali: Well … you’d need to know about your area of responsibility … and your salary of course and then there are things like <span class="s1"><strong>holiday entitlement </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>maternity or paternity leave </strong></span>… if you’re thinking of having children … and what the situation is regarding <span class="s1"><strong>sick leave </strong></span>… that kind of thing …</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What are the advantages of having your own business rather than working for someone else? Julie: Well … unfortunately being an employee at the moment is very stressful … people have very <span class="s1"><strong>heavy workloads </strong></span>… they’re always under pressure to <span class="s1"><strong>meet deadlines </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>running your own business </strong></span>isn’t easy … but I do think it would be far more satisfying …</p>
