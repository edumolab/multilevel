<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you enjoy using technology? Stephan: Well … I wouldn’t call myself <span class="s1"><strong>a techie </strong></span>or a <span class="s1"><strong>computer buff </strong></span>but I enjoy using computers … I’d like to find out more about how they work … when my <span class="s1"><strong>computer crashes </strong></span>I never know what to do.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you use the Internet for your studies? Sophie: Yes … I’d be lost without it … I do lots of <span class="s1"><strong>video conferencing </strong></span>to practise speaking and <span class="s1"><strong>social media </strong></span>like Facebook is a good way to meet up with other students … and I <span class="s1"><strong>download podcasts </strong></span>that teach English vocabulary and grammar.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Do you have your own computer? Tania: Yes … I have a Macbook Pro … I use it all the time … for <span class="s1"><strong>word processing </strong></span>… <span class="s1"><strong>browsing websites </strong></span>and catching up with TV programmes I’ve missed.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2-style task</span> </strong></h3>

</ul>
<p class="p1">Mattie: I don’t have many <span class="s1"><strong>gadgets </strong></span>… just a computer … a laptop and my mobile phone … but I’ll talk about my computer as it’s so useful … it’s funny really … 2 years ago I was still learning to use computers … how to use email … <span class="s1"><strong>send attachments </strong></span>how to <span class="s1"><strong>access websites </strong></span>… then I decided to do a <span class="s1"><strong>digital editing </strong></span>course for video and photography … and so I bought the laptop when I started the course … my husband had a <span class="s1"><strong>desktop PC </strong></span>but it was very slow so I decided <span class="s1"><strong>to upgrade </strong></span>to a powerful one because we do a lot of video editing on the course … it’s a <span class="s1"><strong>high-spec </strong></span>laptop … very fast … the latest <span class="s1"><strong>operating system </strong></span>… it <span class="s1"><strong>boots up </strong></span>really quickly and it’s fun to use so it makes working a pleasure … I’ve become a competent computer user now … if I didn’t have it I daresay I’d have to spend more time at college using their computers … but on the positive side I suppose I’d read a lot more if I didn’t have it … I probably waste a lot of time <span class="s1"><strong>surfing the web </strong></span>… but hopefully I won’t have to be without it …</p>

Alejandro: Well … there are things like how to use the Internet … how <span class="s1"><strong>to enter a web address </strong></span>… how <span class="s1"><strong>to navigate websites </strong></span>… that kind of thing but it’s also important to know how <span class="s1"><strong>to back up </strong></span>your files in case your computer crashes … and all about <span class="s1"><strong>Internet security</strong></span>.</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: What kind of technological developments have made the biggest impact on our lives? Faydene: In my lifetime it has to be the Internet of course but I also think wifi has made a huge difference to how we interact with the Internet … <span class="s1"><strong>wireless networks </strong></span>at home and public <span class="s1"><strong>wifi hotspots </strong></span>mean we can <span class="s1"><strong>go online </strong></span>easily … <span class="s1"><strong>access our mail </strong></span>… log into our work intranet and basically be connected wherever we are.</p>
<p class="p1">Examiner: Do computers make it much easier to study? Jane: Definitely yes … researching information is much easier with the Internet .. you can <span class="s1"><strong>bookmark webpages </strong></span>for future reference and writing essays is much easier … being able <span class="s1"><strong>to cut and paste </strong></span>sections of text means you can experiment with organisation … so yes … compared to years ago when you had a pile of books on your desk and a pen and paper … it’s now much easier.</p>
