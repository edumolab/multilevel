      que: "Describe your favorite season of the year. You should say. What the weather is like.Why you like this season.What activities you usually do during this season. How different kinds of weather in this season affect people.",
      ans: "Today, I am going to tell you about my favourite season. Honestly, I love all the seasons but I think my favourite is spring. Usually, it starts at the end of December in our country and lasts till the middle of March. The weather in Vietnam is the best during spring because you will not suffer from the excessive heat of summer or the freezing wind of winter. The temperature is tolerable both day and night. One of the best things about spring is that, during this poetic season, nature displays itself in beautiful green and flowers are noticed everywhere. Fruit trees, such as cherry and apricot trees are in full blossom, and colourful flowers such as daffodils and marigolds bloom in parks and gardens. The sounds of spring are wonderful too. A typical spring day will begin when some birds start their morning chorus as they look for a mate. We also celebrate Tet, one of the most anticipated holidays by the Vietnamese people. This is an occasion for pilgrimages, family reunions and many festivals. Parties full of delicious traditional dishes are the main theme for the whole holiday of Tet.I am of the opinion that different kinds of weather can affect people’s health. Even among those in the prime of health, an excessively hot or cold day can lead to illness or injury, let alone the elderly, who can be more susceptible to extreme weather conditions. Weather can also make a huge impact on people's lives. Obviously, the weather dictates what you are going to wear for the day, often depending on the time of year. Also, winter snow storms in Western countries can cancel school or make your morning commute a hassle.",

      que:"Describe a public place that you think needs improvements. You should say: What the place is.  When you visit the place. What do you like and dislike about the public place",
      ans:"I would like to talk about a public place that I think needs improvement. Among the most popular public places where people can socialise and hang out with each other is Dam Sen, an amusement park in Ho Chi Minh city, considered a green oasis located in District 11.Last month, I decided to take my nieces and nephews there. The park is comprised of many areas including a roller coaster which, to my surprise, the children eagerly rode. Time just flew by with the kids. We liked everything about the park except the fact that people were throwing empty water bottles here and there. I felt there should be more bins. Well, to tell the truth, the park is rather old. Sometimes my parents used to take me there in my childhood. However, the park was a lot different from what I could remember. Some facilities at its far end were covered in moss and overgrown weeds. The crumbling walls gave the impression that the area had been abandoned for ages. One day, to our terror, we found some used needles laying amidst the shabby greenery, invisible and able to pierce the common light-weight shoes the children wear.I would say that the city authority should encourage local people or voluntary groups to tidy up the park and hire more care-takers to make it a safer and more attractive playground for children. Also, a certain amount of money is needed to install new restrooms and other safety-oriented upgrades like street lighting or warning signs.",

      que:"Describe a city or country you want to live the most in the future. You should say: • What city it is. • Where it is located. • Why you like it.",
      ans:"I would like to tell you about Tokyo, the city I want to live in the most in the future. It is the capital city of Japan and is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. The most important reason I wish to settle down in Tokyo is the co-existence of modern and traditional values. It’s the kind of city where the red gates of a centuries-old Shinto shrine may well be found just next door to a glass skyscraper showcasing the finest 21st century technology. Or where a quiet green lane lined with wooden low-rise houses and an old school tofu shop might sit just a short stroll from a neon-lit square packed with flickering billboards and rainbow-bright street fashion.The hectic life in Tokyo is also an irresistible attraction for young people. Tokyo's railway system seems like it was designed to win world records. It's rare to find a location in the metropolitan area that can't be reached with a train ride and a short walk. It is also common knowledge that you could spend hours drooling over the elaborate pastries and picture-perfect sushi rolls in a department store.I feel that the city is moving toward the future. I believe Tokyo will become a city that is full of surprises."

      que:"Describe something you learned in a place/from a person. You should say: • What you learned. • When this happened. • Where it was/ Who taught you. • How difficult it was to learn.",
      ans:"I am so lucky to have the chance to learn so many things from the people around me; the list of things I have learnt would be a very long one. I would like to emphasise one thing that I learned from a middle-aged woman in my neighborhood, and that is the pleasure of voluntary activities. We call her Ms. Lan. She was born and grew up during one of the most turbulent periods in Vietnamese modern history. Now, in her late 50s, she became interested in trying to make a difference — working for her own volunteer organization. She has been running a group of dedicated, compassionate young people who are all committed to making a positive difference to the lives of senior citizens in nursing homes around the town. “Spending time with the elderly is very important, they don’t always have relatives to visit them so I try to fill that gap and spend a bit of time with them. I have a rapport with elderly people, I’m a patient person and I like to sit down and talk to them,” she once told us. During my working under her guidance, I have learnt about the benefits of working as a volunteer. If you have ever volunteered, you may have noticed that you felt fantastic afterward. Community service can help you gain confidence by giving the chance to try something new and build a real sense of achievement. Besides, volunteering can help you meet different kinds of people and make new friends.Generally speaking, volunteering can have a real and valuable positive affect on people, communities and society. Besides, I believe that we can learn much about life from those who have seen it almost to the end."

      ans:"I am going to talk about how satisfied I was when receiving good service from a music shop a couple of months ago.One day, after watching a really motivational concert, I decided to start learning how to play the guitar. As I was walking along one of the main shopping streets in the city centre to look for a music shop, a large window displaying all sorts of musical instruments caught my eye. I decided to go in and have a look around.A young good-looking shop assistant appeared and greeted me with a glowing smile. After exchanging pleasantries, I explained to the assistant that I had never played the guitar before in my life and that I wondered what the differences were between the various acoustic guitars on show. He talked to me about the different makes and models, whether they were factory or hand made, the woods and varnishes used, the variation in sound quality and, of course, the price range. Though I was a bit overwhelmed by what he said as a non-musician, I highly appreciated his attitude.To tell the truth, it is difficult to find very smart and efficient customer service nowadays. I was quite satisfied with the service the young man provided, he was obviously well-trained, and he was patient enough to fully understand what my problem was and used his professional skills to deal with it. Besides, he was very proficient in acoustic guitar playing, and seemed reliable to me."

      ans:"Well, the first sentimental item that came to mind when I saw this topic was the stuffed animal named Marsupilami. This special toy was a birthday present. I can't remember exactly how old I was, but I was probably about 5 or 6. This toy was important to me because I longed for it and it was a gift from my parents.The toy was identical to the character in the cartoon I had watched. Therefore, I felt as if he had come from the movie. Marsupilami was a black-spotted yellow monkey-like creature with dog-like ears. The animals were characterized by an incredibly long, strong and flexible tail, used for almost any task. As a kid, this was a fascinating and exciting toy for me. In the beginning, I did not allow any of my cousins and friends to touch Marsupilami. Marsupilami used to sit proudly on my bed each and every day, and every night he 'slept' next to my pillow. Thanks to the toy, I experienced a happy childhood. As the saying goes, 'Teddy bears don't need hearts as they are already stuffed with love.' This is also true for my beloved Marsupilami."

      ans:"A famous person who I am really interested in is definitely My Tam. She is the best pop singer in Viet Nam who embarked on her singing career in 1999. The Da Nang-born singer has recently become Vietnam’s first-ever artist to be listed on Billboard’s World Albums chart, after releasing her ninth studio album ‘Tam 9’. My Tam is my biggest idol because she is a great singer with beautiful voice. Some years ago, I caught a glimpse of her on TV and was immediately hooked by her outstanding performance. I have became her loyal fan since then. I really like the way she sings and the way she expresses the feeling of the song. To my admiration, she has always worked seriously to give high quality music products. My Tam is beloved for her good personality too. She is known to all her fans for her gregariousness and sense of humour. Besides, she has also devoted her time to organizing free concerts for univeristy students nationwide. Together with her fans and friends, she has been doing a lot of charity activities silently to help the poor, the sick and the homeless people."

      ans:"I am going to talk about a photo that I took some years ago when my family went on holiday in Phan Thiet beach. The picture captured the memory of a very happy family. This is a priceless possession to me and I would like to keep it with me for the rest of my life. I have seen it thousands times and still I look at it with an indescribable delight. In the picture, everyone was smiling cheerfully. My father’s eyes were sparkling and the corners of his eyes crinkled. To tell the truth, it was very rare to see my father’s smile as he always kept a serious facial expression. Needless to say, my mother was standing next to him with warm happiness glowing in her face. My younger brothers and sisters were not really photogenic because they were bursting out laughing for a reason I could not remember clearly. In the back ground, the sun looked like it was gradually receding into the waters below. The sky consisted of an assortment of shades, a blend of reds, oranges and yellows. The water below was mirroring this effect. The scene was beautiful. I have to admit that I know very little about the technical aspects of camera and to be honest I take photos from my own preference rather than maintaining aspects a professional photographer would do. Though the photo was not professionally shot, it is still the most treasured photo I could have."

      ans:"An enjoyable event I would like to talk here is the Sports Competition that happened in my middle school stage. At the time, my classmates and I were at most twelve or thirteen years old. The main purpose of this event was to motivate students to do more sports on the understanding that participating in sports is one of the best ways to keep fit both physically and mentally. There were so many joyful things happening, that I cannot tell you all of them. The day started with track events. There were 50, 100 and 200 meters races. There was tremendous applause from the spectators, which included teachers and parents. Then the field events: tug of war, long jump, high jump and shot put were held. Every event drew cheers and applause from the spectators. The day went by very fast. I came in first in the long jump event, and second in the 100 metre race and shot put. At about five o’clock, our Guest-of-Honour gave away the trophies to the winners. My class was overall runners-up. The sports day turned out to be the grandest day of the year for the school. The crowd, the music, the competition, the excitement of the game, and the liveliness and spontaneous actions of the spectators were noteworthy. After the competition, we all realize that the necessity of sports is immense in human life. It energises people who participate in the events and the pleasures are inexpressible."

      ans:"I would like to start by saying that I always try to be polite in all situations, because that was how I was brought up. However, I have to admit that there are just some individuals out there who enjoying feeding on negative energy. It happened when I had to work in a team with other university friends on an assignment in Economic Studies. In our group then, there was one person who I disliked because he always had half-baked knowledge on everything and a perception that he knew everything. His attitude made everyone in our group really annoyed and sometimes the teamwork became stressful. So, regarding why I had to be polite, it was because we had to work together over a period of about four months and ensure the best outcome. Although it was difficult at first because of his personality and the fact that he always thought that he was right and had the best ideas, eventually we all managed to work as a team and by the end of the project he wasn't really as bad as he had been at the beginning and was more willing to collaborate with the rest of us in the group. And that was my experience of being nice to someone I disliked. The incident helped me understand that it is impossible to shield yourself from negativity, so the only things you can do are learn how to deal with hateful people and grow thicker skin."

      ans:"Today I would like to talk about one of the guests who visited my family and left a great impression on me. His name was Armane, a French man and my brother’s business partner for more than 2 years. I heard from my mother that my brother happened to meet him at yoga and meditation class. Last week, he came to our house to say goodbye before returning to Paris. Armane had a masculine look, with large blue eyes and a wide forehead. His sharp nose looked perfect, too. Though an European man, he seemed to have a profound understanding of Vietnamese culture. The way he used the chopsticks and rolled the vegetables with rice paper told me that he was deeply aware of our customary table manners. Armane also shared with us that at first he found it really stressful to follow such a minefield of social no-no’s. Within a week of his visit, Armane surprised us with a thank-you card which he meticulously made himself. We were really happy to hear from Armane. Although my parents were understanding of foreigners’ unfamiliarity with the norms of Vietnamese society, they were really impressed that Armane can master many of the traditional practices. He earnt our utmost respect."

      ans:"Ho Chi Minh City is a popular tourist destination due to its fascinating culture, classic French architecture, sleek skyscrapers as well as ornate temples and pagodas. As a result, it is pretty difficult to pick out one particular place among millions of tourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City. Personally, I believe that Bitexco Financial Tower is the most impressive skyscraper. It is located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City’s business and entertainment district. At completion in 2010, it became the tallest building in Vietnam until January 2011. The creative mastermind behind Bitexco drew inspiration for this skyscraper’s unique shape from Vietnam’s national flower, the lotus. To the Vietnamese, the lotus is a symbol of purity, commitment and optimism. This 68-storey building features many offices, shops, restaurants. The main attraction at the tower is the Sky Deck where visitors can enjoy dramatic views across the bustling city below. There are lots of places I like to go in Ho Chi Minh city, depending on my mood. If you want to enjoy the hectic and modern lifestyle, Bitexco is an ideal attraction to consider."

      ans:"I am going to talk about the Mekong river, one of the biggest and most important rivers located in southwestern part of Vietnam. With a length of about 2,700 miles, the river is the 7th longest is Asia. Locally, it's called 'River of the Nine Dragons' because the small branches of the river are, since time immemorial, associated with the image of nine majestic dragons. Needless to say, the river is mentioned in a variety of poems and songs. In terms of agriculture, the mighty river together with its surrounding delta has been known as the agricultural heart of southern Vietnam and the ‘rice bowl’ of the whole country. The Mekong is also Vietnam's most important fishing region. If you are a discerning tourist who really has ‘wearing a conical hat in a sampan boat in Vietnam’ on your bucket list, a trip to Mekong Delta is a must. It is carpeted in a dizzying variety of greens and is also a place where boats, houses and markets float upon the innumerable rivers, canals and streams that criss-cross the landscape like arteries. Embarking on a Mekong River cruise provides tourists with fascinating insight into the local rural way of life, including the opportunity to visit some of the region’s best-known sites, along with plenty of hidden gems."

      ans:"I’m going to talk about a friend I met in college who goes by the name Moon. I met her during our freshman year orientation, and I personally think I was very lucky to have been introduced to her. She is a Chinese student whom everybody adores. I have known her for 3 years, and in all those 3 years, I have never once been bored by her or her presence. She is always energetic and fun to be with. We had a lot of classes together in our first year and she always came to help me with my homework in the weekends. I got to know her better through our reviews for exams together and our hangouts after class. Cheerful as she might have appeared to be, she received a lot of pressure from her parents about good grades and getting into a good graduate school. I admire the way she always tried to stay positive despite all the stress she was under. Now that we’re in our final year of university, I don’t see her as often anymore. But once in a while, she sends me a message to check how I’m doing with my schoolwork and I really appreciate her for that. Either way, I know that I have cherished our time together, and that whether or not we can keep being in each other’s lives, I will always look back on our college experiences with great fondness."

      ans:"I would like to share a funny story that I heard from Julie, a friend of mine, a long time ago. It was a random day that our group hung out at a coffee shop and sat at the circle table near the window, as we usually do. This was our favourite spot. But that day, instead of ordering a cappuccino as I usually do, I decided to try a completely new drink – mojito mixed with some fruit, though I can’t remember exactly what. The mojito looked good on the outside but its taste was unbearable to me. Despite my warning, Julie insisted on trying it. It turned out that she liked the drink very much and in that moment, she concluded that it tasted exactly like the toothpaste that she ate in her childhood. Learning of this incident, we were a bit shocked as to why she ate such a thing, so she continued to elaborate on her story. She recalled that she indeed thought that the taste of toothpaste was delicious, and even she was banned from eating it by her parents, she secretly saved money to buy one for herself a few years later. She added that she sneakily hid the yube in the room and she could finish the whole thing in one go. We were frozen and all eyes were on her for a few seconds. Then we all burst into laughter. I still remember laughing so hard that my tears ran down. I was indeed impressed by her story. As the matter of fact, it wasn’t the first time I had heard of someone enjoying eating toothpaste, but secretly saving money to do this was a surprise element and it was hilarious. And of course, it has become an inside joke between us since then."
