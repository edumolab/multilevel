<h3>What do you do in your free time?</h3>
<p>I love reading and writing when I have some free time available. Apart from these, I also like playing badminton. So, whenever I do get time, I usually read, write or play badminton.</p>
<h3>Do you have a busy social life?</h3>
<p>Yes, I do have quite a busy social life as I have a lot of friends with whom I often meet sometimes to celebrate someone's birthday or other important events. Even I love to intermingle with like-minded people in social gatherings.</p>
<h3>Has your life changed much in the last year?</h3>
<p>Yeah, in certain aspects. Last year I was out of the job due to covid, but this year I’m gainfully employed. I also own a business, and I live independent now, whereas last year, I was dependent on my sister.</p>
<h3>What would you like to change about your lifestyle?</h3>
<p>I want to cultivate a habit of early sleeping because it will not only help me to wake up early in the morning but will also help me to strike a balance between my professional and personal life.</p>
<h3>Do you enjoy your current stage of life</h3>
<p>Definitely! I’m so blessed to have parents who are supportive of me financially and emotionally. They support all my endeavors, especially my mom, she’s my greatest cheerleader and I can’t thank her enough. I don’t know what my life would be like without them.</p>

<h3>Describe a healthy lifestyle you know.</h3>
  <p>You should say:
    <ul>
      <li>What is it?</li>
       <li>How do you know it?</li>
       <li>When do you do it?</li>
       <li>And explain why you think it is healthy</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These days, people have become highly health-conscious as they are investing a lot of time and effort in keeping healthy and fit.<br />
      Here, I would like to put some light on a healthy lifestyle that is effective and can
      be followed effortlessly.</p>
      <p>I have been feeling inactive and sluggish for the last few weeks, which has
      affected my productivity levels. During this time, I was scrounging through ways to
      get out of this monotonous phase. Scrolling through the internet, I stumbled upon
      an article on a healthy lifestyle. It emphasized taking a morning walk to stay active
      and fit. Reading through its pros, I realized that it was time to give it a try.
      So, I have started visiting a local park in the morning for the last few days. Once
      there, I take a brisk walk, breathe in the fresh air and spend some time lying on
      the lush green grass.</p>
      <p>So far, I have noticed minor but significant changes in myself. I have started being
      mentally fit along with physical fitness. Simultaneously, I have also started
      consuming a healthy diet comprising dairy products, fresh fruits and green
      vegetables. It has helped me get out of the exhaustive phase and improved my
      concentration levels. Therefore, I think it is healthy and can be taught easily in our
      daily lives.</p>

  <h3>What are some ways that people can quickly make their lives better?</h3>
  <p>There are a few different approaches to rapidly improving a person’s lifestyle, such as
    buying some useful luxury items, like the Tesla I just mentioned. And, another one that
    comes to mind is eating healthier as this seems to help energy and positive mood in just
    a matter of days.</p>
    <h3>What are the best ways to achieve these?</h3>
    <p>Through working diligently and smartly people can earn lots of money which in turn they
      can wisely invest into products that improve their overall well-being, such as the 120K
      dollar Tesla that I talk about. In the case of improving one’s diet, this has to be a
      conscientious decision, and a person has to make clear plan and shop and cook accordingly.</p>
      <h3>Do you agree that we learn best from our mistakes?</h3>
      <p>People say that the mistakes we make are our best teachers because they can teach
        us many things. In fact, some of the most important life lessons, we would ever learn,
        will be from our mistakes or bad decisions.</p>
        <h3>What’s the best way to gain experience in life?</h3>
        <p>Well, in my opinion, the best way to gain experience is to do some experimentations,
          and take some calculated risks and random decisions even when we know that we
          would probably “fail” in some real-life situations. And, as we make those little
          experimentations or make random decisions, we can reflect on the outcomes or
          experiences, whether we fail or succeed.</p>
