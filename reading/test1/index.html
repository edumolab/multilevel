    <h5>Questions 1-6.</h5>
<p>In the UK, <input type="text"  id="ex1" required> celebrate Pancake Day. This festival takes place in February, on Shrove Tuesday. This is the day before Lent. Lent is an important time in the Christian calendar. It lasts 47 days. During Lent, people traditionally stop eating delicious <input type="text" class="ex-input"  id="ex2" required> , like cakes and chocolate. So on Shrove Tuesday, they must eat up all the nice food in their cupboards. So they make pancakes, and they often eat them with lemon and sugar.</p>

<p>Many British towns hold pancake races on Shrove Tuesday. People wear fancy dresses and run down the street with a pancake in a pan. They must throw the <input type="text" id="ex3" required>  in the air and catch it in the pan as they run. It must not fall on the ground.</p>

<p>The tradition of pancake <input type="text" id="ex4" required>  started in Olney, Buckinghamshire. According to a story, a housewife made pancakes on Easter Sunday in 1445. Then she heard the church bells. She was worried because she was late for <input type="text" id="ex5" required> , so she ran to church with her <input type="text" id="ex6" required> and pancake in her hand! Now, Olney’s pancake race is famous.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> David enjoys walking but he has injured his knee and cannot climb up hills. He would like to spend a couple of hours on a quiet walk with well-marked paths.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Luigi likes to get as much exercise as possible and particularly likes climbing steep hills to get a good view. He wants to do a walk that is difficult and offers a range of scenery.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Yannis has two sons of 8 and 10. He would like to take them to see some animals in the countryside. He wants to be able to buy some refreshments.</p>
<p><strong>10. </strong>Amada has had an operation and needs plenty of fresh air to help her recover. She wants to find a short, quiet walk with a beautiful place to visit on the route.</p>
<p><strong>11. </strong>Claudia's grandparents are staying with her. They are very fit and enjoy walking. They would like to visit some of the local villages and need a clearly-marked route so they don't lose their way.</p>
<p><strong>12. </strong>Mike, Kathy and their three children don't have much money, but they want a special day out this Saturday. They must be back home by 9 p.m.</p>

<p><strong>A. MARIE LIFE, FRANCE.</strong> The chance to experience the oceans of the world. Children will love the observatory, with water all around them and enormous fish swimming above their heads! Afterwards you eat at a world-famous local restaurant before boarding the ferry at 9 p.m. Not cheap, but a great day out!</p>
<p><strong>B. SEA PATH.</strong> This walk starts at the village of Nye Flats and the excellent signposts lead you through local streets, fields and pretty neighbouring villages. Although it will take you half a day, there are no hills at all. You can breathe the sea air and enjoy watching traditional life in busy villages.</p>
<p><strong>C. CUTTERS WAY.</strong> This walk can take anything from 30 minutes to two hours. It's not a good walk for hill-lovers as the ground is completely flat, but it has good signposts and simple facilities for the hungry or thirsty walker. A few places or things to see would improve this walk, which can be a little dull.</p>
<p><strong>D. PADDOCK WAY.</strong> This is really a short track across a working farm. There are plenty of chickens and sheep to see, and the farmer has turned some of the buildings into an educational centre with a caf&eacute;. Not a walk for those who like peace and quiet, but good fun.</p>
<p><strong>E. HURDLES.</strong> This is a route for the experienced walker. It crosses two rivers and includes hills of up to 500 metres, from which you can see the sea. There are several rocky paths that are unsuitable for children or older people and there are no shops so take plenty of water.</p>
<p><strong>F. NEVERLAND.</strong> This is a walk to take if you have a whole day to spare and want to escape from other people. It follows a narrow track which is clearly marked and has different routes for different types of walker. There are hills to climb but views are limited because of thick forest.</p>
<p><strong>G. FRENCH HYPERMARKET DAY TRIP.</strong> Whether you want to buy or just look, you'll love this tour. The enormous Darney shopping centre is a shopper's dream! You will find a great number of local goods on sale, and clothes and kitchen goods are excellent value. Free children's entertainment all day. Leaves 10:00, back at 19:00.</p>
<p><strong>H. GOLD-DIGGERS END.</strong> You won't find any gold on this peaceful walk, but you will find plenty of other things to see including a lovely garden which is open to the public. It's a half-hour walk with a couple of small caf&eacute;s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>I. A TASTE OF THE GOOD LIFE IN FRANCE.</strong> After a relaxing voyage, you visit a beautiful area which is famous for its good things to eat. There you can enjoy some sightseeing and choose from a number of wonderful restaurants. Sail back on the night crossing. Sorry, adults only!</p>
<p><strong>J. SEA AND MOUNTAINS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.</strong> Explore the Northern Ireland countryside, including the amazing Mountains of Mourne and the small seaside holiday town of Newcastle. The ferry leaves the port in Scotland at 7:30 and arrives back at 22:20. Transport in Northern Ireland is by air-conditioned coach.</p>

headings below. There are more headings than paragraphs, so you will not use all of
them. You cannot use any heading more than once.</p>
    <h6>The Rise and Fall of Ephesus</h6>
<p><strong>A.</strong> People have lived at the site and the surroundings for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found evidence dating from Neolithic times. There were also settlements during the Bronze Age, although no architectural structures remain from this period. The precise location of the city during these times cannot be firmly established, as the river has moved over the centuries. The once busy harbour has also vanished.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> However, about 2000 years ago, the diverse leaders of the city started elaborate city planning projects. We can tell what a sophisticated society this was, from some of the ruins. The most impressive are the elaborately decorated remains of the front wall of a huge library. This used to contain thousands of papers. There is also a theatre with a capacity to seat 25,000, possibly the biggest theatre of its time. Wide roads paved with marble also remain, and a complex system of aqueducts. These carried water to public baths and water mills, which cut the marble for building. Women&rsquo;s rights were honoured, possibly because of the importance of goddess-worship, and there were even female artists.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The city was well-known as the site of the enormous Temple of Artemis. This was considered to be the finest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. People came from far away to worship the goddess Artemis, establishing Ephesus as a major destination fortravellers. The temple had to be completely re-built three times before it was finally destroyed in 401 AD. It was first destroyed by a flood, later deliberately burnt down by a lunatic, and was eventually destroyed in a Gothic raid. All that remains is a broken column,standing crookedly in the middle of a marsh.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> At its peak, about 300,000 people lived in the city, making it second only in size to Rome in the ancient world. Not only was it densely populated, it was also a key trading city, situated in a strategic location on the Aegean Sea. Its position in a fertile valley gave its people another source of income from agriculture, and they could easily export their products. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, it was the capital of the region, and a new era of prosperity began.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> As with many beautiful cities of strategic importance, Ephesus was constantly fought over. It changed hands and allegiance many times, and was part of the Greek, Roman, Persian, Byzantine and Ottoman Empires. During Roman rule, taxes rose and the city&rsquo;s treasures were stolen. At one point, Ephesus was self-governing, but this was only for a short time. When the Romans took over again, the citizens were forced to pay taxes retrospectively.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> In 50 AD, Ephesus became an important centre of Christianity, and is mentioned in the Bible. Key leaders of the early church lived in the city. These included the apostle Paul, who wrote much of the Bible, and it is thought that Mary, the mother of Jesus, died in Ephesus.The position of Ephesus at the heart of Christianity is ironic, as for many years, the city had been best known for the Temple to Artemis. When many citizens converted to Christianity, the local silver-workers were furious, scared of losing their livelihood making silver statues of the goddess.</p>

        <h5>Questions 21-29.</h5>
        <h4><strong>Read the following text for questions 21-29</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Learning lessons from the past</strong></p>
<p>Many past societies collapsed or vanished, leaving behind monumental ruins such as those that the poet Shelley imagined in his sonnet, Ozymandias. By collapse, I mean a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable, for an extended time. By those standards, most people would consider the following past societies to have been famous victims of full-fledged collapses rather than ofjust minor declines: the Anasazi and Cahokia within the boundaries of the modem US, the Maya cities in Central American, Moche and Tiwanaku societies in South America, Norse Greenland, Mycenean Greece and Minoan Crete in Europe, Great Zimbabwe in Africa, Angkor Wat and the Harappan Indus Valley cities in Asia, and Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The monumental ruins left behind by those past societies hold a fascination for all of us. We marvel at them when as children we first learn of them through pictures. When we grow up, many of us plan vacations in order to experience them at first hand. We feel drawn to their often spectacular and haunting beauty, and also to the mysteries that they pose. The scales of the ruins testify to the former wealth and power of their builders. Yet these builders vanished, abandoning the great structures that they had created at such effort.</p>
<p>How could a society that was once so mighty end up collapsing?It has long been suspected that many of those mysterious abandonments were at least partly triggered by ecological problems: people inadvertently destroying the environmental resources on which their societies depended. This suspicion of unintended ecological suicide (ecocide) has been confirmed by discoveries made in recent decades by archaeologists, climatologists, historians, palaeontologists, and palynologists (pollen scientists). The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by damaging their environments fall into eight categories, whose relative importance differs from case to case: deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems, water management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population growth, and increased impact of people.</p>
<p>Those past collapses tended to follow somewhat similar courses constituting variations on a theme. Writers find it tempting to draw analogies between the course of human&nbsp; societies and the course of individual human lives &ndash; to talk of a society&rsquo;s birth, growth, peak, old age and eventual death. But that metaphor proves erroneous for many past societies: they declined rapidly after reaching peak numbers and power, and those rapid declines must have come as a surprise and shock to their citizens. Obviously, too, this trajectory is not one that all past societies followed unvaryingly to completion: different societies collapsed to different degrees and in somewhat different ways, while many societies did not collapse at all.</p>
<p>Today many people feel that environmental problems overshadow all the other threats to global civilisation. These environmental problems include the same eight that undermined past societies, plus four new ones: human-caused climate change, the build-up of toxic chemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilisation of the Earth&rsquo;s photosynthetic capacity. But the seriousness of these current environmental problems is vigorously debated. Are the risks greatly exaggerated, or conversely are they underestimated? Will modem technology solve our problems, or is it creating new problems faster than it solves old ones? When we deplete one resource (eg wood, oil, or ocean fish), can we count on being able to substitute some new resource (eg plastics, wind and solar energy, or farmed fish)? Isn&rsquo;t the rate of human population growth declining, such that we&rsquo;re already on course for the world&rsquo;s population to level off at home manageable number of people?</p>
<p> Questions like this illustrate why those famous collapses of past civilisations have taken on more meaning than just that of a romantic mystery. Perhaps there are some practical lessons that we could learn from all those past collapses. But there are also differences between the modem world and its problems, and those past societies and their problems. We shouldn&rsquo;t be so naive as to think that the study of the past will yield simple solutions, directly transferable to our societies today. We differ from past societies in some respects that put us at lower risk than them; some of those respects often mentioned include our powerful technology (ie its beneficial effects), globalisation, modem medicine, and greater knowledge of past societies and of distant modem societies. We also differ from past societies in some respects that put us at greater risk than them: again, our potent technology (ie its unintended destructive effects), globalisation (such that now a problem in one part of the world affects all the rest), the dependence of millions of us on modern medicine for our survival, and our much larger human population. Perhaps we can still learn from the past, but only if we think carefully about its lessons.</p>

         <h2>Part 5</h2>
    <h5>The Persuaders</h5>
<p><b>A.</b> We have long lived in an age where powerful images, catchy soundbites and too-good to miss offers to bombard us from every quarter. All around us the persuaders are at work. Occasionally their methods are unsubtle –the planting kiss on a baby’s head by a wannabe political leader, or a liquidation sale in a shop that has been “closing down” for well over a year, but generally the persuaders know what they are about and are highly capable. Be
they politicians, supermarket chains, salespeople or advertisers, they knowexactly what to
do to sell us their images, ideas or produce. When it comes to persuasion, these giants
rule supreme. They employ the most skilled image-makers and use the best psychological
tricks to guarantee that even the most cautious among us are open to manipulation.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> We spend more time in them than we mean to, we buy 75 percent of our food from
them and end up with products that we did not realize we wanted. Right from the start,
supermarkets have been ahead of the game. For example, when Sainsbury introduced
shopping baskets into its 1950s stores, it was a stroke of marketing genius. Now
shoppers could browse and pick up items they previously would have ignored. Soon after
came trolleys, and just as new roads attract more traffic, the same applied to trolley space.
Pro Merlin Stone, IBM Professor of Relationship Marketing at Bristol Business School,
says aisles are laid out to maximize profits. Stores pander to our money-rich, time-poor
lifestyle. Low turnover products —clothes and electrical goods—are stocked at the back
while high—turnover items command position at the front.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> Stone believes supermarkets work hard to “stall” us because the more time we spend in
them, the more we buy. Thus, great efforts are made to make the environment pleasant.
Stores play music to relax us and some even pipe air from the in-store bakery around the
shop. In the USA, fake aromas are sometimes used. The smell is both the most evocative
and subliminal sense. In experiments, pleasant smells are effective in increasing our
spending. A casino that fragranced only half its premise saw profit soar in the
aroma—filled areas. The other success story from the supermarkets’ perspective is the
loyalty card. Punters may assume that they are being rewarded for their fidelity, but all the
while they are trading information about their shopping habits. Loyal shoppers could be
paying 30% more by sticking to their favourite shops for essential cosmetics.</p>
<p><b>D.</b> Research has shown that 75 percent of profit comes from just 30 percent of customers.
Ultimately, reward cards could be used to identify and better accommodate these “elite”
shoppers. It could also be used to make adverts more relevant to individual consumers –
rather like Spielberg’s futuristic thriller Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise’s character is
bombarded with interactive personalized ads. If this sounds farfetched, the data-gathering
revolution has already seen the introduction of radio –frequency identification – away to
electronically tag products to see who is buying what, FRID means they can follow the
product into people homes.</p>
<p><b>E.</b> No matter how savvy we think we are to their ploys, the ad industry still wins. Adverts
focus on what products do or on how they make us feel. Researcher Laurette Dube, in the
Journal of Advertising Research, says when attitudes are base on “cognitive foundations”
(logical reasoning), advertisers use informative appeals. This works for products with a
little emotional draw but high functionality, such as bleach. Where attitude is based on
effect (i.e, emotions), ad teams try to tap into our feelings.Researchers at the University of
Florida recently concluded that our emotional responses to adverts dominate over
“cognition”.</p>
<p><b>F.</b> Advertisers play on our need to be safe (commercials for insurance), to belong (make a
customer feel they are in the group in fashion ads) and for self-esteem (aspirational
adverts). With time and space at a premium, celebrities are often used as a quick way of
meeting these needs – either because the celeb epitomizes success or because they
seem familiar and so make the product seem “safe”. A survey of 4,000 campaigns found
ads with celebs were 10 percent more effective than without. Humor also stimulates a
rapid emotional response. Heiman Chung, writing in the International Journal of
Advertising, found that funny ads were remembered for longer than straight ones.
Combine humor with sexual imagery – as in Wonderbra’s “Hello Boys” ads—and you are
on to a winner.</p><br><br>
